Meanwhile, outside the building, FBI agents arrive, and Robinson, the LAPD officer in charge, meets with them. \n\nRobinson tries to downplay John McClane's involvement, but Powell, a colleague, points out that McClane is the one who provided them with information about the terrorists. \n\nInside the building, McClane and Hans form an uneasy alliance. McClane tries to reassure Hans, who is still shaken, and they share a cigarette. \n\nHowever, Hans' true intentions are revealed when he pulls out a gun and orders McClane to hand over his detonators. McClane refuses, and a tense standoff ensues. \n\nJust as it seems like McClane has the upper hand, Hans' accomplices, Karl and Franco, arrive, and a fierce gun battle erupts. McClane takes cover behind a water cooler and then retreats to a bank of computers. \n\nAs he dodges bullets, McClane manages to take out Franco, but Hans reappears and snatches up Franco's gun. McClane is forced to retreat, and Hans uses the glass shards to his advantage, ordering Karl to shoot the glass and creating a hail of debris. \n\nMcClane takes a risk and blasts a burst to keep their heads down, then jumps onto a counter and runs across the room, bullets following close behind. He dives and rolls to the floor, but not before his foot gets caught on a shard. \n\nMcClane manages to escape through a stairwell door, leaving Hans and Karl behind."
