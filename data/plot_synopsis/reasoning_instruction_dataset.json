The attack on Chrissie Watkins is the inciting incident that drives the plot forward.\n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 7): This is the Change of Plans turning point as it marks a significant escalation in the shark's attacks, leading to increased action and a clearer goal for the main characters - to stop the shark. The death of the young boy raises the stakes and sets the story in progress.\n\nTurning Point 3 (Sentence 20): This is the Point of No Return turning point as it marks the moment when the main characters - Brody, Hooper, and Quint - fully commit to their goal of killing the shark. They set out to sea, and there's no turning back, leading to complications and high-stake difficulties.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 30): This is the Major Setback turning point as it marks a significant setback for the characters. Quint's obsession leads to the burning out of the Orca's engine, leaving them stranded and vulnerable to the shark's attack. This event sets the story in motion towards the final push.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 38): This is the Climax turning point as it marks the final confrontation between Brody and the shark. The explosion of the scuba tank and the shark's subsequent death resolve the main conflict, leading to the aftermath of the story.\nFINAL ANSWER:\n1,7,20,30,38<|eot_id|>"

Ipkiss (Jim Carrey) works at an Edge City bank.\nSentence 1:\nHe is tormented by nearly everyone except for his Jack Russell Terrier Milo and his co-worker Charlie Schumaker (Richard Jeni).\nSentence

singer girlfriend Tina Carlyle (Cameron Diaz) into Stanley's bank to record its layout, in preparation to rob the bank.\nSentence 4:\nStanley is attracted to Tina, and she seems to reciprocate.\nSentence 5:\nAfter being denied entrance to the Coco Bongo, he finds a mysterious wooden mask near the city's harbor.\nSentence 6:\nPlacing it on his face transforms him into a zoot-suited, green-faced, bizarre trickster known as The Mask, who is able to cartoonishly alter himself and his surroundings at will.\nSentence 7:\nThe transformed Stanley exacts revenge on some of his tormentors, including the auto mechanics who had ripped him off the night before and his bullying landlord Mrs. Peenman (Nancy Fish).\nSentence 8:\nWhen a street gang attempts to rob him, he scares them by turning a balloon into a Tommy gun.\nSentence 9:\nThe next morning, Stanley encounters Lieutenant Kellaway (Peter Riegert), Detective Doyle (Jim Doughan), and newspaper reporter Peggy Brandt (Amy Yasbeck) investigating The Mask's activity.\nSentence 10:\nDespite being sought by the police, he again becomes The Mask in order to steal money targeted by Tyrell and attend Tina's performance.\nSentence 11:\nAt the Coco Bongo, The Mask dances exuberantly with Tina, whom he ends up kissing.\nSentence 12:\nFollowing a confrontation with Tyrell, The Mask flees, leaving behind a scrap of cloth belonging to himself.\nSentence 13:\nKellaway suspects that Stanley is behind the bank robbery, but Stanley dissuades him.\nSentence 14:\nStanley consults an expert on masks named Dr. Arthur Neuman (Ben Stein), who tells him that the object is a depiction of Loki, the Norse god of darkness and mischief.\nSentence 15:\nStill later, Stanley transforms into The Mask again and meets Tina at the local Landfill Park.\nSentence 16:\nHe is interrupted by Kellaway and Doyle, who attempt to arrest him.\nSentence 17:\nHowever The Mask distracts them by tricking a large group of Edge City police officers into joining him in a mass performance of the Desi Arnaz song \"Cuban Pete\".\nSentence 18:\nStanley flees with Peggy, but he is betrayed to Tyrell for a $50,000 bounty.\nSentence 19:\nTyrell tries on the mask and becomes a malevolent green-faced being.\nSentence 20:\nForced to reveal the location of the stolen money, Stanley is kept hostage in one of the mob's cars while Tyrell's henchmen reclaim the money.\nSentence 21:\nStanley is later handed over to Kellaway and Doyle, along with a green rubber mask, to be detained.\nSentence 22:\nWhen Tina visits Stanley in his cell, he urges her to flee the city.\nSentence 23:\nTina thanks Stanley for treating her with respect and tells him that she knew that he was The Mask all along.\nSentence 24:\nShe tries to leave the city, but is captured by Orlando and Tyrell.\nSentence 25:\nThey take her to a charity ball hosted by Niko and attended by the city's elite, including the city's mayor, Mitchell Tilton (Ivory Ocean).\nSentence 26:\nAt the ball, the masked Tyrell kills Niko and prepares to destroy both the club and Tina.\nSentence 27:\nMilo helps Stanley escape from prison, and bringing Kellaway as a cover and hostage, they go to the club to stop Tyrell.\nSentence 28:\nAfter briefly securing the assistance of Charlie, Stanley is spotted by Orlando and captured.\nSentence 29:\nTina tricks Tyrell into taking off the mask, which is recovered and donned by Milo, turning the dog into a cartoonish pitbull who defeats Tyrell's men while Stanley fights Tyrell.\nSentence 30:\nAfter recovering the mask, Stanley uses its abilities to save Tina by swallowing Tyrell's bomb and flushing Tyrell down the drain of the club's ornamental fountain.\nSentence 31:\nThe police arrive and arrest Tyrell's remaining henchmen, while Kellaway and Doyle try to arrest Stanley again claiming his real identity as The Mask.\nSentence 32:\nMayor Tilton arrives and debunks Kellaway's claims by announcing that Tyrell was The Mask the whole time because he was one of the victims that was taken hostage by the thug at Coco Bongo.\nSentence 33:\nHe tells Stanley that he is a hero, thanks him for saving lives, and orders the police to release him.\nSentence 34:\nIn a desperate attempt to prove Stanley was The Mask, Kellaway and Doyle try to claim off Milo for assisting in his escape, but Tilton is not in the mood for their antics.\nSentence 35:\nHe goes on to say that he will need to meet with both men in his office the next morning to discuss their early retirement.\nSentence 36:\nAll charges against Stanley are dropped, while Kellaway and Doyle must face Tipton's judgment.\nSentence 37:\nThe next day, as the sun rise, Stanley, Tina, Milo, and Charlie take the mask back down to the harbor.\nSentence 38:\nTina throws the mask into the water, and she and Stanley celebrate their victory with a kiss.\nSentence 39:\nCharlie tries to retrieve the mask for himself, only to find Milo swimming away with it.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 6): This is the opportunity that drives the narrative from setup to new situation, as Stanley finds the mysterious wooden mask and transforms into The Mask, gaining cartoonish powers and a new persona.

secret non-government agency that polices extraterrestrial alien refugees that are residing on Earth and are disguised as humans, created in 1961 after the first contact.\nSentence 1:\nThe agency operates from an underground base at a Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority ventilation station in Battery Park.\nSentence 2:\nMIB members use neuralyzers on witnesses' memories of alien sightings, therefore the secrecy of the presence of aliens and the MIB itself is extremely secretive.\nSentence 3:\nMIB is monitoring about 1500 aliens around the world, most of them in the vicinity of New York City.\nSentence 4:\nOne night, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and his partner, D (Richard Hamilton) intercept a truck containing illegal immigrants, and allow everyone to cross into America except for an extraterrestrial, who is disguised as a human because he is an intergalactical fugitive.\nSentence 5:\nWhen a suspicious United States Border Patrol agent, who saw K and D pose as fellow Border Patrol agents, sees the alien without its disguise, the alien attacks him, forcing K to destroy it and use the neuralyzer on the agent and his colleagues, claiming that the alien remains splattered all over them are from when the agent shot an underground gas main with his gun.\nSentence 6:\nD, feeling too old, asks K to use the neuralyzer on him.\nSentence 7:\nMeanwhile, James Darrell Edwards III (Will Smith) is a New York police officer pursuing a man on foot while his out-of-shape colleagues can't catch up.\nSentence 8:\nWhile chasing the incredibly fast and agile fugitive, he corners him and the man throws an odd looking gun away, which disintegrates, and escapes.\nSentence 9:\nWhen Edwards corners the man again at the top of the (Guggenheim Museum), he sees the man blink with a set of secondary eyelids before jumping over the roof and killing himself.\nSentence 10:\nK arrives at the precinct station, (where no one believes Edwards's incredible story), questions Edwards about the incident, then takes him to a pawnshop run by a man named Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub), an MIB informant who Edwards knew for dealing stolen goods, to identify the strange weapon the criminal drew on him.\nSentence 11:\nWhile questioning Jeebs, K reveals Jeebs is an alien by blowing his head off with a weapon, which grows back immediately.\nSentence 12:\nAfter Edwards finds a weapon identical to the one he saw among Jeebs' hidden stash of alien technology, K realizes that the gun was meant to be used in an assassination, but Jeebs is unable to provide any further information.\nSentence 13:\nK uses the neuralyzer on Edwards, takes him to dinner, and leaves him an MIB business card.\nSentence 14:\nLater, Edwards goes to the MIB's secret headquarters and competes with several others to qualify to join the agency.\nSentence 15:\nDuring one part of the test, a written exam, the candidates struggle to complete the test due to the oddly shaped chairs, until Edwards pulls a table over for him to use.\nSentence 16:\nat another part involving a shooting gallery, Edwards refuses to shoot several aliens because he thinks that they are doing normal everyday things, but shoots a little girl for carrying suspicious quantum physics textbooks.\nSentence 17:\nAfter the tests, K takes him aside (while Zed uses the neuralyzer on the others for failing the tests) and offers him the position.\nSentence 18:\nEdwards accepts and his identity is erased, becoming Agent J, and explains the nature of MIB and tells him that he will have to distance himself from any human contact to maintain secrecy, and that he will get his own neuralyzer when he learns.\nSentence 19:\nSuspicious of why extraterrestrials are suddenly leaving the planet, the M.I.B. investigate a farmer named Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio), who has been acting strangely after an alien craft crashed on his farm and destroying his truck.\nSentence 20:\nEdgar has been killed and his skin used as a disguise by a \"Bug\", a member of a giant cockroach-like species that are at war with several other alien races, including the Arquillians and the humans.\nSentence 21:\nAn Arquillian prince hiding in Brooklyn who is disguised as a human jewelry store owner is attacked by the \"bug\" and appears to die along with his friend.\nSentence 22:\nThe body is taken to the city morgue and investigated by Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino).\nSentence 23:\nDuring the investigation K and J arrive at the morgue posing as Doctors.\nSentence 24:\nThe head of the dead Arquillian \"opens\" while being examined by Dr Weaver and J reavealing the actual Arquillian prince.\nSentence 25:\nWhile dying the Arquillian tells J that \"the galaxy is on Orion's belt\".\nSentence 26:\nM.I.B. informant Frank the Pug (Tim Blaney), a Remoonian disguised as a small lapdog, explains that the missing galaxy is a massive source of energy housed in a small jewel.\nSentence 27:\nThe Bug figures out the galaxy is hanging on the collar of Rosenberg's cat Orion, which refuses to leave the prince's body at the morgue.\nSentence 28:\nOrion has been taken care of by Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino).\nSentence 29:\nJ

secret non-government agency that polices extraterrestrial alien refugees that are residing on Earth and are disguised as humans, created in 1961 after the first contact.\nSentence 1:\nThe agency operates from an underground base at a Triborough Bridge and Tunnel Authority ventilation station in Battery Park.\nSentence 2:\nMIB members use neuralyzers on witnesses' memories of alien sightings, therefore the secrecy of the presence of aliens and the MIB itself is extremely secretive.\nSentence 3:\nMIB is monitoring about 1500 aliens around the world, most of them in the vicinity of New York City.\nSentence 4:\nOne night, Agent K (Tommy Lee Jones) and his partner, D (Richard Hamilton) intercept a truck containing illegal immigrants, and allow everyone to cross into America except for an extraterrestrial, who is disguised as a human because he is an intergalactical fugitive.\nSentence 5:\nWhen a suspicious United States Border Patrol agent, who saw K and D pose as fellow Border Patrol agents, sees the alien without its disguise, the alien attacks him, forcing K to destroy it and use the neuralyzer on the agent and his colleagues, claiming that the alien remains splattered all over them are from when the agent shot an underground gas main with his gun.\nSentence 6:\nD, feeling too old, asks K to use the neuralyzer on him.\nSentence 7:\nMeanwhile, James Darrell Edwards III (Will Smith) is a New York police officer pursuing a man on foot while his out-of-shape colleagues can't catch up.\nSentence 8:\nWhile chasing the incredibly fast and agile fugitive, he corners him and the man throws an odd looking gun away, which disintegrates, and escapes.\nSentence 9:\nWhen Edwards corners the man again at the top of the (Guggenheim Museum), he sees the man blink with a set of secondary eyelids before jumping over the roof and killing himself.\nSentence 10:\nK arrives at the precinct station, (where no one believes Edwards's incredible story), questions Edwards about the incident, then takes him to a pawnshop run by a man named Jack Jeebs (Tony Shalhoub), an MIB informant who Edwards knew for dealing stolen goods, to identify the strange weapon the criminal drew on him.\nSentence 11:\nWhile questioning Jeebs, K reveals Jeebs is an alien by blowing his head off with a weapon, which grows back immediately.\nSentence 12:\nAfter Edwards finds a weapon identical to the one he saw among Jeebs' hidden stash of alien technology, K realizes that the gun was meant to be used in an assassination, but Jeebs is unable to provide any further information.\nSentence 13:\nK uses the neuralyzer on Edwards, takes him to dinner, and leaves him an MIB business card.\nSentence 14:\nLater, Edwards goes to the MIB's secret headquarters and competes with several others to qualify to join the agency.\nSentence 15:\nDuring one part of the test, a written exam, the candidates struggle to complete the test due to the oddly shaped chairs, until Edwards pulls a table over for him to use.\nSentence 16:\nat another part involving a shooting gallery, Edwards refuses to shoot several aliens because he thinks that they are doing normal everyday things, but shoots a little girl for carrying suspicious quantum physics textbooks.\nSentence 17:\nAfter the tests, K takes him aside (while Zed uses the neuralyzer on the others for failing the tests) and offers him the position.\nSentence 18:\nEdwards accepts and his identity is erased, becoming Agent J, and explains the nature of MIB and tells him that he will have to distance himself from any human contact to maintain secrecy, and that he will get his own neuralyzer when he learns.\nSentence 19:\nSuspicious of why extraterrestrials are suddenly leaving the planet, the M.I.B. investigate a farmer named Edgar (Vincent D'Onofrio), who has been acting strangely after an alien craft crashed on his farm and destroying his truck.\nSentence 20:\nEdgar has been killed and his skin used as a disguise by a \"Bug\", a member of a giant cockroach-like species that are at war with several other alien races, including the Arquillians and the humans.\nSentence 21:\nAn Arquillian prince hiding in Brooklyn who is disguised as a human jewelry store owner is attacked by the \"bug\" and appears to die along with his friend.\nSentence 22:\nThe body is taken to the city morgue and investigated by Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino).\nSentence 23:\nDuring the investigation K and J arrive at the morgue posing as Doctors.\nSentence 24:\nThe head of the dead Arquillian \"opens\" while being examined by Dr Weaver and J reavealing the actual Arquillian prince.\nSentence 25:\nWhile dying the Arquillian tells J that \"the galaxy is on Orion's belt\".\nSentence 26:\nM.I.B. informant Frank the Pug (Tim Blaney), a Remoonian disguised as a small lapdog, explains that the missing galaxy is a massive source of energy housed in a small jewel.\nSentence 27:\nThe Bug figures out the galaxy is hanging on the collar of Rosenberg's cat Orion, which refuses to leave the prince's body at the morgue.\nSentence 28:\nOrion has been taken care of by Dr. Laurel Weaver (Linda Fiorentino).\nSentence 29:\nJ arrives at the morgue just as the Bug kidnaps Weaver and grabs the galaxy.\nSentence 30:\nThe Arquillians deliver an ultimatum to M.I.B. to secure the galaxy within an hour, or they will destroy Earth.\nSentence 31:\nThe Bug arrives at the site of two disguised flying saucers, the observation towers of the New York State Pavilion at Flushing Meadows.\nSentence 32:\nK and J are close behind and destroy one saucer, causing it to crash through the Unisphere.\nSentence 33:\nThe Bug sheds Edgar's skin and swallows J's and K's guns.\nSentence 34:\nK tells J to stop the Bug from getting onto the other ship, then taunts the Bug until K too is swallowed.\nSentence 35:\nJ infuriates the Bug by crushing cockroaches and taunting him.\nSentence 36:\nThe Bug is blown open from the inside by K, who located his weapon in the Bug's stomach.\nSentence 37:\nAs J and K sit on the ground covered in slime, the mortally wounded insect tries to attack again, but is killed by Weaver using J's

Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) flies a F-14A Tomcat off USS\u00a0Enterprise\u00a0(CVN-65), with Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards) as his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO).\nSentence 1:\nAt the start of the film, Maverick and his wingman \"Cougar\" (John Stockwell), intercept (fictional) MiG-28s over the Indian Ocean.\nSentence 2:\nDuring the standoff, one of the MiGs manages to get a missile lock on Cougar.\nSentence 3:\nMaverick realizes that the MiG is only trying to intimidate Cougar and drives it off, but Cougar is too shaken afterward to land.\nSentence 4:\nMaverick defies orders and shepherds Cougar back to the carrier as both planes run critically low on fuel.\nSentence 5:\nAfter they land, Cougar retires (\"turns in his wings\"), stating that he has been holding on \"too tight\" and has lost \"the edge\", almost orphaning his newborn child, whom he has never seen.\nSentence 6:\nAlthough disapproving of Maverick's reckless flying and repeated violations of rules, the Enterprise's CAG \"Stinger\" (James Tolkan) sends Maverick and Goose\u2014now his top crew\u2014to attend the Navy's Fighter Weapons School, known as \"Top Gun\", at NAS Miramar.\nSentence 7:\nIt is revealed that Maverick's recklessness is partly due to his father, Duke Mitchell, who served with the VF-51 squadron aboard the USS\u00a0Oriskany\u00a0(CV-34) during the Vietnam War, and was killed in action when his Phantom was shot down.\nSentence 8:\nThe official story, which Maverick refuses to believe, is that Duke made a mistake.\nSentence 9:\nGoose is much more cautious and devoted to his wife, Carole (Meg Ryan), and child.\nSentence 10:\nThe two officers are nonetheless close friends and effective partners, with Maverick considering Goose as his only family.\nSentence 11:\nAt a bar the day before the Top Gun program starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman named Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood (Kelly McGillis), who he later learns is a civilian contractor with a Ph.D. in astrophysics serving as a Top Gun instructor.\nSentence 12:\nMaverick's reckless flying both annoys and impresses Lieutenant Commander Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly (Michael Ironside) and other instructors.\nSentence 13:\nHe defeats Jester in exercises, but violates two rules of engagement in the process and is strongly reprimanded by the chief instructor, Commander Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf (Tom Skerritt).\nSentence 14:\nMaverick continues to pursue Charlie and becomes a rival to top student Lieutenant Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer)\u2014who considers Maverick's methods dangerous and unsafe.\nSentence 15:\nAlthough outwardly critical of Maverick's tactics, Charlie eventually admits that she admires his flying but was critical because she was afraid for her credibility.\nSentence 16:\nThey begin a romantic relationship.\nSentence 17:\nDuring one flight, Maverick breaks off from his wingman \"Hollywood\" to go one-on-one with Viper, described as \"the finest fighter pilot in the world\".\nSentence 18:\nAlthough Maverick matches the older pilot move for move, Viper lasts long enough for Jester\u2014who has defeated Hollywood off-screen\u2014to maneuver around and \"shoot\" Maverick down, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual ability.\nSentence 19:\nNear the end of the program, Maverick and Iceman both chase Jester, the latter attempting to gain a missile lock on the target.\nSentence 20:\nUnder intense pressure from Maverick, Iceman breaks off.\nSentence 21:\nMaverick's F-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a flameout of both engines, entering a flat spin from which he cannot recover, forcing both Maverick and Goose to eject.\nSentence 22:\nGoose ejects directly into the jettisoned aircraft canopy, which breaks his neck, killing him.\nSentence 23:\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility, he feels guilty for Goose's death, losing his aggressiveness when flying.\nSentence 24:\nCharlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers leaving the Navy.\nSentence 25:\nUnsure of his future, he seeks Viper's advice.\nSentence 26:\nViper reveals that he served with Maverick's father and discloses classified details over his last mission, explaining how Duke stayed in the fight after his Phantom was hit and saved three planes before he died.\nSentence 27:\nInformation about the dogfight was classified to avoid revealing that the American planes were not where they should have been.\nSentence 28:\nDuring the graduation party, Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately report to the Enterprise to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken communications ship, the SS Layton, that has drifted into hostile waters.\nSentence 29:\nMaverick and Merlin are assigned to one of two F-14s as back-up for those flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind.\nSentence 30:\nIn the subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs, Hollywood is shot down but he and his RIO, Wolfman, manage to eject safely.\nSentence 31:\nMaverick is sortied alone due to catapult failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death.\nSentence 32:\nUpon rejoining Iceman, they shoot down four MiGs and force the others to flee, and return to the Enterprise, where the two men, with newfound respect for each other, finally become friends.\nSentence 33:\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Top Gun as an instructor, to which Stinger jokingly expresses horror.\nSentence 34:\nLater, he is seen tossing Goose's dogtags into the ocean, suggesting that he is finally free of his guilt over Goose's death.\nSentence 35:\nSitting alone in a restaurant in downtown San Diego, Maverick hears \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" playing on the jukebox and recalls meeting Charlie.\nSentence 36:\nShe reveals that she is in the bar and the two reunite."

Lieutenant Pete \"Maverick\" Mitchell (Tom Cruise) flies a F-14A Tomcat off USS\u00a0Enterprise\u00a0(CVN-65), with Nick \"Goose\" Bradshaw (Anthony Edwards) as his Radar Intercept Officer (RIO).\nSentence 1:\nAt the start of the film, Maverick and his wingman \"Cougar\" (John Stockwell), intercept (fictional) MiG-28s over the Indian Ocean.\nSentence 2:\nDuring the standoff, one of the MiGs manages to get a missile lock on Cougar.\nSentence 3:\nMaverick realizes that the MiG is only trying to intimidate Cougar and drives it off, but Cougar is too shaken afterward to land.\nSentence 4:\nMaverick defies orders and shepherds Cougar back to the carrier as both planes run critically low on fuel.\nSentence 5:\nAfter they land, Cougar retires (\"turns in his wings\"), stating that he has been holding on \"too tight\" and has lost \"the edge\", almost orphaning his newborn child, whom he has never seen.\nSentence 6:\nAlthough disapproving of Maverick's reckless flying and repeated violations of rules, the Enterprise's CAG \"Stinger\" (James Tolkan) sends Maverick and Goose\u2014now his top crew\u2014to attend the Navy's Fighter Weapons School, known as \"Top Gun\", at NAS Miramar.\nSentence 7:\nIt is revealed that Maverick's recklessness is partly due to his father, Duke Mitchell, who served with the VF-51 squadron aboard the USS\u00a0Oriskany\u00a0(CV-34) during the Vietnam War, and was killed in action when his Phantom was shot down.\nSentence 8:\nThe official story, which Maverick refuses to believe, is that Duke made a mistake.\nSentence 9:\nGoose is much more cautious and devoted to his wife, Carole (Meg Ryan), and child.\nSentence 10:\nThe two officers are nonetheless close friends and effective partners, with Maverick considering Goose as his only family.\nSentence 11:\nAt a bar the day before the Top Gun program starts, Maverick, assisted by Goose, unsuccessfully approaches a woman named Charlotte \"Charlie\" Blackwood (Kelly McGillis), who he later learns is a civilian contractor with a Ph.D. in astrophysics serving as a Top Gun instructor.\nSentence 12:\nMaverick's reckless flying both annoys and impresses Lieutenant Commander Rick \"Jester\" Heatherly (Michael Ironside) and other instructors.\nSentence 13:\nHe defeats Jester in exercises, but violates two rules of engagement in the process and is strongly reprimanded by the chief instructor, Commander Mike \"Viper\" Metcalf (Tom Skerritt).\nSentence 14:\nMaverick continues to pursue Charlie and becomes a rival to top student Lieutenant Tom \"Iceman\" Kazansky (Val Kilmer)\u2014who considers Maverick's methods dangerous and unsafe.\nSentence 15:\nAlthough outwardly critical of Maverick's tactics, Charlie eventually admits that she admires his flying but was critical because she was afraid for her credibility.\nSentence 16:\nThey begin a romantic relationship.\nSentence 17:\nDuring one flight, Maverick breaks off from his wingman \"Hollywood\" to go one-on-one with Viper, described as \"the finest fighter pilot in the world\".\nSentence 18:\nAlthough Maverick matches the older pilot move for move, Viper lasts long enough for Jester\u2014who has defeated Hollywood off-screen\u2014to maneuver around and \"shoot\" Maverick down, demonstrating the value of teamwork over individual ability.\nSentence 19:\nNear the end of the program, Maverick and Iceman both chase Jester, the latter attempting to gain a missile lock on the target.\nSentence 20:\nUnder intense pressure from Maverick, Iceman breaks off.\nSentence 21:\nMaverick's F-14 flies through the jet wash of Iceman's aircraft and suffers a flameout of both engines, entering a flat spin from which he cannot recover, forcing both Maverick and Goose to eject.\nSentence 22:\nGoose ejects directly into the jettisoned aircraft canopy, which breaks his neck, killing him.\nSentence 23:\nAlthough the board of inquiry clears Maverick of responsibility, he feels guilty for Goose's death, losing his aggressiveness when flying.\nSentence 24:\nCharlie and others attempt to console him, but Maverick considers leaving the Navy.\nSentence 25:\nUnsure of his future, he seeks Viper's advice.\nSentence 26:\nViper reveals that he served with Maverick's father and discloses classified details over his last mission, explaining how Duke stayed in the fight after his Phantom was hit and saved three planes before he died.\nSentence 27:\nInformation about the dogfight was classified to avoid revealing that the American planes were not where they should have been.\nSentence 28:\nDuring the graduation party, Iceman, Hollywood, and Maverick are ordered to immediately report to the Enterprise to deal with a \"crisis situation\", providing air support for the rescue of a stricken communications ship, the SS Layton, that has drifted into hostile waters.\nSentence 29:\nMaverick and Merlin are assigned to one of two F-14s as back-up for those flown by Iceman and Hollywood, despite Iceman's reservations over Maverick's state of mind.\nSentence 30:\nIn the subsequent hostile engagement with six MiGs, Hollywood is shot down but he and his RIO, Wolfman, manage to eject safely.\nSentence 31:\nMaverick is sortied alone due to catapult failure and nearly retreats after encountering circumstances similar to those that caused Goose's death.\nSentence 32:\nUpon rejoining Iceman, they shoot down four MiGs and force the others to flee, and return to the Enterprise, where the two men, with newfound respect for each other, finally become friends.\nSentence 33:\nOffered any assignment he chooses, Maverick decides to return to Top Gun as an instructor, to which Stinger jokingly expresses horror.\nSentence 34:\nLater, he is seen tossing Goose's dogtags into the ocean, suggesting that he is finally free of his guilt over Goose's death.\nSentence 35:\nSitting alone in a restaurant in downtown San Diego, Maverick hears \"You've Lost That Lovin' Feelin'\" playing on the jukebox and recalls meeting Charlie.\nSentence 36:\nShe reveals that she is in the bar and the two reunite.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 6): This

Somerset is partnered with short-tempered Detective David Mills who recently transferred to the department.\nSentence 1:\nThe detectives investigate a series of murders relating to the seven deadly sins, such as an obese man who was forced to feed himself to death, representing \"Gluttony.\"\nSentence 2:\nThey find clues at each crime scene related to other deaths, and believe they are chasing a serial killer.\nSentence 3:\nA set of fingerprints found at the scene of the \"Greed\" murder, the fatal bloodletting of a rich attorney, leads them to an apartment where they find an emaciated man strapped to a bed.\nSentence 4:\nThough he initially appears to be dead, it soon is discovered that the man has been kept alive and entirely immobile by the killer for exactly one year to the day; a drug dealer and child molester before his captivity, this victim represents \"Sloth\".\nSentence 5:\nThough unable to learn anything from the insensate victim, the detectives agree that the killer has planned these crimes for more than a year.\nSentence 6:\nTracy Mills is unhappy with their recent move to the city.\nSentence 7:\nShe meets Somerset after the first few murders and he becomes Tracy's confidante.\nSentence 8:\nUpon learning that she is pregnant but has not told her husband, Somerset confides in her his fear that the city is no place to start a family, and reveals that he had ended a relationship years earlier after pressuring his girlfriend to have an abortion.\nSentence 9:\nSomerset advises her to not tell Mills if she plans to have an abortion; otherwise, if she decides to keep the child, \"spoil that kid every chance you get\".\nSentence 10:\nUsing library records, Somerset and Mills track down a man named John Doe, who has frequently checked out books related to the deadly sins.\nSentence 11:\nWhen Doe finds the detectives approaching his apartment, he opens fire on them and flees, chased by Mills.\nSentence 12:\nEventually, Doe gains the upper hand and holds Mills at gunpoint, but then abruptly leaves, sparing Mills's life.\nSentence 13:\nInvestigation of Doe's apartment finds handwritten volumes of his irrational judgments and clues leading to another potential victim, but no fingerprints.\nSentence 14:\nThey arrive too late to find their \"Lust\" victim, a prostitute killed by an unwilling man wearing a bladed S&M device, forced by Doe to simultaneously rape and kill her.\nSentence 15:\nSome time later, they investigate the death of a young model whose face had been mutilated.\nSentence 16:\nHaving chosen to kill herself rather than live with a disfigured face, she is the victim of \"Pride\".\nSentence 17:\nAs they return to the police station, Doe appears to them and offers himself for arrest, with the blood of the model and an unidentified victim on his hands.\nSentence 18:\nThey find out that he has been cutting the skin off his fingers to avoid leaving fingerprints.\nSentence 19:\nThrough his lawyer, Doe claims he will lead the two detectives to the last two bodies and confess to the crimes, or otherwise will plead insanity.\nSentence 20:\nThough Somerset is worried, Mills agrees to the demand.\nSentence 21:\nDoe directs the two detectives to a remote desert area far from the city; along the way, he claims that God told him to punish the wicked and reveal the world for the awful place that it is.\nSentence 22:\nHe also makes cryptic comments toward Mills.\nSentence 23:\nAfter arriving at the location, a delivery van approaches; Somerset intercepts the driver, leaving Mills and Doe alone.\nSentence 24:\nThe driver hands over a package he was instructed to deliver at precisely this time and location.\nSentence 25:\nWhile Mills holds Doe at gunpoint, Doe mentions how much he admires him, but does not say why.\nSentence 26:\nSomerset opens the package and recoils in horror at the sight of the contents.\nSentence 27:\nHe races back to warn Mills not to listen to Doe, but the killer reveals that the box contains Tracy's head.\nSentence 28:\nDoe claims to represent the sin of \"Envy\"; he was envious of Mills's normal life, and killed Tracy after failing to \"play husband\" with her.\nSentence 29:\nHe then taunts the distraught Mills with the knowledge that Tracy was pregnant.\nSentence 30:\nSomerset is unable to contain Mills as he kills Doe by shooting him repeatedly, thereby becoming the embodiment of \"Wrath\" and completing Doe's \"work\".\nSentence 31:\nAfter Mills is taken away, Somerset is asked where he will be, and replies, \"around\".<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 5): This is the Opportunity turning point, as it marks the moment when the detectives realize the extent of the killer's planning, and their investigation shifts from a series of unrelated crimes to a cohesive, long-term plan. This understanding drives the narrative from the setup to the new situation.\n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 12): This is the Change of Plans turning point, as it marks a significant shift in the investigation. Doe's actions reveal his intelligence and cunning, and the detectives must adapt their approach to catch him. This event drives the narrative from the introduction of the new situation to its progress.\n\nTurning Point 3 (Sentence 19): This is the Point of No Return turning point, as it marks the moment when the detectives agree to Doe's demands, committing themselves to a course of action that will lead to the climax of the story. This event drives the narrative from the progress to the complications and high-stake difficulties.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 27): This is the Major Setback turning point, as it marks the moment when the detectives, particularly Mills, are faced with a devastating loss. The revelation of Tracy's death sets in motion the events that will lead to the final confrontation. This event drives the narrative from the complications to the final push.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 30): This is the Climax turning point, as it marks the moment of resolution and the culmination of the story's tension.

Captain Samuel Clayton remarks, Ethan \"fits a lot of descriptions\".\nSentence 5:\nShortly after Ethan's arrival, cattle belonging to his neighbor Lars Jorgensen are stolen, and when Captain Clayton leads Ethan and a group of Rangers to recover them, they discover that the theft was a Comanche ploy to draw the men away from their families.\nSentence 6:\nWhen they return they find the Edwards homestead in flames.\nSentence 7:\nAaron, his wife Martha, and their son Ben are dead, and Debbie and her older sister Lucy have been abducted.\nSentence 8:\nAfter a brief funeral the men set out in pursuit.\nSentence 9:\nThey come upon a burial ground of Comanches who were killed during the raid.\nSentence 10:\nEthan mutilates one of the bodies.\nSentence 11:\nWhen they find the Comanche camp, Ethan recommends a frontal attack, but Clayton insists on a stealth approach to avoid killing the hostages.\nSentence 12:\nThe camp is deserted, and further along the trail the men ride into an ambush.\nSentence 13:\nAlthough they fend off the attack, the Rangers are left with too few men to fight the Indians effectively.\nSentence 14:\nThey return home, leaving Ethan to continue his search for the girls with only Lucy's fianc\u00e9, Brad Jorgensen and Debbie's adopted brother, Martin Pawley.\nSentence 15:\nEthan finds Lucy brutally murdered and presumably raped in a canyon near the Comanche camp.\nSentence 16:\nIn a blind rage, Brad rides directly into the Indian camp and is killed.\nSentence 17:\nWhen winter arrives Ethan and Martin lose the trail and return to the Jorgensen ranch.\nSentence 18:\nMartin is enthusiastically welcomed by the Jorgensens' daughter Laurie, and Ethan finds a letter waiting for him from a trader named Futterman, who claims to have information about Debbie.\nSentence 19:\nEthan, who would rather travel alone, leaves without Martin the next morning, but Laurie provides Martin with a horse to catch up.\nSentence 20:\nAt Futterman's trading post, Ethan and Martin learn that Debbie has been taken by Scar, the chief of the Nawyecka band of Comanches.\nSentence 21:\nA year or more later, Laurie receives a letter from Martin describing the ongoing search.\nSentence 22:\nIn reading the letter aloud, Laurie narrates the next few scenes, in which Ethan kills Futterman for trying to steal his money, Martin accidentally buys a Comanche wife, and the two men find a portion of Scar's band killed by soldiers.\nSentence 23:\nThe search leads Ethan and Martin to a military fort, and then to New Mexico, where a Mexican man leads them to Scar.\nSentence 24:\nThey find Debbie after five years, now an adolescent, living as one of Scar's wives.\nSentence 25:\nShe tells the men that she has become a Comanche, and wishes to remain with them.\nSentence 26:\nEthan would rather see her dead than living as an Indian, and tries to shoot her, but Martin shields her with his body and a Comanche wounds Ethan with an arrow as they escape.\nSentence 27:\nAlthough Martin tends to Ethan's wound, he is furious with him for attempting to kill Debbie, and wishes him dead.\nSentence 28:\n\"That'll be the day,\" Ethan replies, as they return home.\nSentence 29:\nMeanwhile, Charlie McCorry has been courting Laurie in Martin's absence.\nSentence 30:\nEthan and Martin arrive home just as Charlie and Laurie's wedding is about to begin.\nSentence 31:\nAfter a fistfight between Martin and Charlie, a nervous \"Yankee\" soldier, Lt. Greenhill, arrives with news that Ethan's half-crazy friend Mose Harper has located Scar.\nSentence 32:\nClayton leads his men to the Comanche camp, this time for a direct attack, but Martin is allowed to sneak in ahead of the assault to find Debbie, who welcomes him.\nSentence 33:\nMartin kills Scar during the battle, and Ethan scalps him.\nSentence 34:\nEthan then locates Debbie, and pursues her on horseback.\nSentence 35:\nMartin fears that he will shoot her as he has promised; but instead he sweeps her up onto his saddle.\nSentence 36:\n\"Let\u2019s go home,\" he says.\nSentence 37:\nDebbie is brought to the Jorgensen ranch, and Martin reunites with Laurie.\nSentence 38:\nIn an iconic closing scene, Ethan departs the homestead as he arrived\u2014alone\u2014clutching his arm, the cabin door slowly shutting on his receding image.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 5): This is the Opportunity turning point as it introduces the central conflict of the story, the Comanche raid, and sets the narrative in motion from setup to new situation. The cattle theft serves as a catalyst for the events that unfold.\n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 8): This is the Change of Plans turning point as it marks the beginning of the pursuit of the Comanches and the search for Debbie and Lucy, defining the main goal of the story and increasing the action. The men's decision to set out in pursuit drives the narrative from the introduction of the new situation to its progress.\n\nTurning Point 3 (Sentence 20): This is the Point of No Return turning point as it provides Ethan and Martin with crucial information about Debbie's whereabouts, pushing them to fully commit to their goal of finding her. This event raises the stakes and drives the narrative from progress to complications and high-stake difficulties.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 25): This is the Major Setback turning point as it reveals that Debbie has become a Comanche and wishes to remain with them, causing a significant obstacle for Ethan and Martin. This event temporarily derails their goal and progresses the story from complications to the final push.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 35): This is the Climax turning point as it marks the moment of resolution, where Ethan decides not to kill Debbie and instead sweeps her up onto his saddle, bringing an end to the main conflict. This event progresses the story from the final push to the aftermath of the main plot.\nFINAL ANSWER:\n5,8,20,25,35<|eot_id|>"

Starling turns around just in time and kills him.\nSentence 25:\nSome time later at her FBI Academy graduation party, Starling receives a phone call from Lecter, who is at an airport in Bimini.\nSentence 26:\nHe assures her that he does not plan to pursue her and asks her to return the favor, which she says she cannot do.\nSentence 27:\nLecter then hangs up the phone, saying that he is \"having an old friend for dinner\" and begins following a newly arrived Chilton before disappearing into the crowd.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 3): This is the opportunity turning point as it marks the moment when Clarice Starling's initial pleasant interaction with Hannibal Lecter turns sour, and he rebuffs her, leading to a change in the direction of their conversation and ultimately, the investigation. This event sets the stage for the new situation where Starling must navigate Lecter's complex personality to gain insight into Buffalo Bill's mind.\n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 10): This is the change of plans turning point as it marks the moment when Lecter begins a game of quid pro quo with Starling, offering comprehensive clues and insights about Buffalo Bill in exchange for information about her own past. This event increases the action and tension in the story, driving the narrative from the introduction of the new situation to its progress.\n\nTurning Point 3 (Sentence 14): This is the point of no return turning point as it marks the moment when Starling is forced to confront her traumatic childhood and recount it to Lecter, leading to a deeper understanding of her character and her motivations. This event pushes Starling to fully commit to her goal of catching Buffalo Bill, driving the narrative from progress to complications and high-stake difficulties.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 17): This is the major setback turning point as it marks the moment when Lecter kills his guards, escapes from his cell, and disappears, leaving Starling without a crucial source of information and insight. This event sets back Starling's investigation and creates a sense of urgency, progressing the story from complications to the final push.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 26): This is the climax turning point as it marks the moment when Starling finally resolves the case and kills Buffalo Bill, and then receives a phone call from Lecter, who is now a free man. This event provides a sense of closure and resolution to the main plot, progressing the story from the final push to the aftermath.\nFINAL ANSWER:\n3,10,14,17,26<|eot_id|>"

Navigator Lambert (Veronica Cartwright) set out to investigate the signal, leaving Warrant Officer Ripley (Sigourney Weaver), Science Officer Ash (Ian Holm), and Engineers Brett (Harry Dean Stanton) and Parker (Yaphet Kotto) behind on the ship.\nSentence 4:\nDallas, Kane, and Lambert discover that the signal is coming from a derelict alien spacecraft.\nSentence 5:\nInside they find the remains of a large alien creature whose ribs appear to have been broken outward from the inside.\nSentence 6:\nMeanwhile, Ripley determines that the transmission is actually some type of warning rather than a distress signal.\nSentence 7:\nKane discovers a vast chamber containing thousands of eggs, one of which releases a creature that attaches to his face.\nSentence 8:\nRendered unconscious, Kane is carried back to the Nostromo.\nSentence 9:\nActing on improper orders from Dallas, Ash violates quarantine protocol by opening the airlock, allowing the exploratory team aboard.\nSentence 10:\nAfter

detaches from Kane's face by itself and is later found dead.\nSentence 12:\nThe Nostromo leaves the planet and resumes its trip to Earth.\nSentence 13:\nKane awakens from his ordeal with some memory loss but no other apparent ill effects.\nSentence 14:\nDuring the crew's final dinner before re-entering stasis, he chokes and convulses until a small alien creature bursts from his chest, killing

flamethrowers.\nSentence 16:\nHowever, the Alien has grown at an unprecedented rate and is now eight feet tall with incredible strength and agility.\nSentence 17:\nIt attacks Brett and disappears with his body into an airshaft.\nSentence 18:\nDallas enters the airshaft network intending to force the Alien into an airlock, but it ambushes him.\nSentence 19:\nWhen the others find no trace of Dallas, Lambert, realizing that the alien is aggressive and intent on killing the entire crew, implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle.\nSentence 20:\nRipley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people, and recommends that they continue with Dallas's plan of cornering and flushing out the Alien.\nSentence 21:\nAccessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to their corporate employers even at the expense of the crew's lives.\nSentence 22:\nAsh then appears and attacks Ripley, but Parker and Lambert intervene, decapitating and impaling Ash, revealing him to be an android.\nSentence 23:\nRipley theorizes that the company wants the Alien for its weapons division.\nSentence 24:\nBefore they destroy his remains, Ash smugly predicts that the others will not survive the indestructible \"perfect organism\" that they are up against.\nSentence 25:\nThe three remaining crew members then agree

Alien has hidden aboard the shuttle.\nSentence 29:\nShe puts on a spacesuit and opens the shuttle's main door, causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien to the shuttle's open doorway.\nSentence 30:\nShe propels it out into space by shooting it with a grappling hook, but the gun catches in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the shuttle.\nSentence 31:\nAs it attempts

distress signal.\nSentence 7:\nKane discovers a vast chamber containing thousands of eggs, one of which releases a creature that attaches to his face.\nSentence 8:\nRendered unconscious, Kane is carried back to the Nostromo.\nSentence 9:\nActing on improper orders from Dallas, Ash violates quarantine protocol by opening the airlock, allowing the exploratory team aboard.\nSentence 10:\nAfter an unsuccessful attempt by Ash to surgically remove the creature from Kane's face, the crew discover that the creature's blood contains a corrosive acid.\nSentence 11:\nThe creature eventually detaches from Kane's face by itself and is later found dead.\nSentence 12:\nThe Nostromo leaves the planet and resumes its trip to Earth.\nSentence 13:\nKane awakens from his ordeal with some memory loss but no other apparent ill effects.\nSentence 14:\nDuring the crew's final dinner before re-entering stasis, he chokes and convulses until a small alien creature bursts from his chest, killing him.\nSentence 15:\nThe creature escapes into the ship and, lacking conventional weapons, the crew attempts to locate and capture it by fashioning motion trackers, electric prods, and flamethrowers.\nSentence 16:\nHowever, the Alien has grown at an unprecedented rate and is now eight feet tall with incredible strength and agility.\nSentence 17:\nIt attacks Brett and disappears with his body into an airshaft.\nSentence 18:\nDallas enters the airshaft network intending to force the Alien into an airlock, but it ambushes him.\nSentence 19:\nWhen the others find no trace of Dallas, Lambert, realizing that the alien is aggressive and intent on killing the entire crew, implores the remaining crew members to escape in the ship's shuttle.\nSentence 20:\nRipley, now in command, explains that the shuttle will not support four people, and recommends that they continue with Dallas's plan of cornering and flushing out the Alien.\nSentence 21:\nAccessing the ship's computer, Ripley discovers that Ash has been ordered to return the Alien to their corporate employers even at the expense of the crew's lives.\nSentence 22:\nAsh then appears and attacks Ripley, but Parker and Lambert intervene, decapitating and impaling Ash, revealing him to be an android.\nSentence 23:\nRipley theorizes that the company wants the Alien for its weapons division.\nSentence 24:\nBefore they destroy his remains, Ash smugly predicts that the others will not survive the indestructible \"perfect organism\" that they are up against.\nSentence 25:\nThe three remaining crew members then agree to arm the Nostromo's self-destruct mechanism and escape in the shuttle, but Parker and Lambert are ambushed and killed by the Alien while gathering necessary coolant supplies.\nSentence 26:\nNow alone, Ripley initiates the self-destruct sequence herself and heads for the shuttle with the crew's cat, but finds the Alien blocking her way.\nSentence 27:\nShe retreats and unsuccessfully attempts to abort the self-destruct, then returns to find the Alien gone and narrowly escapes in the shuttle as the Nostromo explodes.\nSentence 28:\nAs she prepares to enter stasis, Ripley discovers that the Alien has hidden aboard the shuttle.\nSentence 29:\nShe puts on a spacesuit and opens the shuttle's main door, causing explosive decompression which forces the Alien to the shuttle's open doorway.\nSentence 30:\nShe propels it out into space by shooting it with a grappling hook, but the gun catches in the closing door, tethering the Alien to the shuttle.\nSentence 31:\nAs it attempts to crawl into one of the engines, Ripley activates them and blasts the alien into space.\nSentence 32:\nShe then puts herself and Jones the cat into stasis and resumes the voyage back home.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 1): This is the opportunity that sets the story in motion, as the crew is awakened to investigate a mysterious transmission, driving the narrative from setup to new situation. The crew's decision to investigate the signal marks a turning point in their journey.\n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 14): This is the change of plans, as Kane's encounter with the alien creature sets the main goal of the story in motion - the crew's survival and attempt to eliminate the alien threat. This event increases the action and tension, driving the narrative from the introduction of the new situation to its progress.\n\nTurning Point 3 (Sentence 19): This is the point of no return, as Lambert realizes the alien's aggressive intentions and the crew's chances of survival are slim, pushing them to fully commit to their goal of escaping the ship. This event marks a turning point in the crew's desperation and willingness to take risks.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 25): This is the major setback, as Parker and Lambert are ambushed and killed by the alien, leaving Ripley alone and increasing the stakes. This event marks a turning point in the story, as Ripley is now forced to fend for herself and find a way to escape.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 31): This is the climax, as Ripley finally manages to blast the alien into space, marking the resolution of the main conflict and the end of the alien threat.

(Roberts) who is willing to assist him in getting to his destination.\nSentence 2:\nThe morning after, Edward hires Vivian to stay with him for a week as an escort for social events.\nSentence 3:\nVivian advises him that it \"will cost him,\" and Edward agrees to give her $3,000 and access to his credit cards.\nSentence 4:\nVivian then goes shopping on Rodeo Drive, only to be snubbed by

relents and decides to help her buy a dress, even coaching her on dinner etiquette.\nSentence 7:\nEdward returns and is visibly amazed by Vivian's transformation.\nSentence 8:\nThe business dinner does not end well, however, with Edward making clear his intention to dismantle Morse's corporation once it was bought, close down the shipyard which Morse spent 40 years building, and sell the land for real estate.\nSentence 9:\nMorse and his grandson abandon their dinner in anger, while Edward remains preoccupied with the deal afterward.\nSentence 10:\nBack at the hotel, Edward reveals to Vivian that he had not spoken to his recently deceased father for 14 and half years.\nSentence 11:\nLater that night, the two make love on the grand piano in the hotel lounge.\nSentence 12:\nThe next morning, Vivian tells Edward about the snubbing that took place the day before.\nSentence 13:\nEdward takes Vivian on a shopping spree.\nSentence 14:\nVivian then returns, carrying all the bags, to the shop that had snubbed her, telling the salesgirls they had made a big mistake.\nSentence 15:\nThe following day, Edward takes Vivian to a polo match where he is interested in networking for his business deal.\nSentence 16:\nWhile Vivian chats with David Morse, the grandson of the man involved in Edward's latest deal, Philip Stuckey (Edward's attorney) wonders if she is a spy.\nSentence 17:\nEdward re-assures him by telling him how they met, and Philip (Jason Alexander) then approaches Vivian and offers to hire her once she is finished with Edward, inadvertently insulting her.\nSentence 18:\nWhen they return to the hotel, she is furious with Edward for telling Phillip about her.\nSentence 19:\nShe plans to leave, but he apologizes and persuades her to see out the week.\nSentence 20:\nEdward leaves work early the next day and takes a breath-taking Vivian on a date to the opera in San Francisco in his private jet.\nSentence 21:\nShe is clearly moved by the opera (which is La Traviata, whose plot deals with a rich man tragically falling in love with a courtesan).\nSentence 22:\nWhile playing chess with Edward after returning, Vivian persuades him to take the next day off.\nSentence 23:\nThey spend the entire day together, and then have sex, in a personal rather than professional way.\nSentence 24:\nJust before she falls asleep, Vivian admits that she's in love with Edward.\nSentence 25:\nOver breakfast, Edward offers to put Vivian up in an apartment so he can continue seeing her.\nSentence 26:\nShe feels insulted and says this is not the \"fairy tale\" she wants.\nSentence 27:\nHe then goes off to work without resolving the situation.\nSentence 28:\nVivian's friend, Kit De Luca (Laura San Giacomo), comes to the hotel and realizes that Vivian is in love with Edward.\nSentence 29:\nEdward meets with Mr. Morse, about to close the deal, and changes his mind at the last minute.\nSentence 30:\nHis time with Vivian has shown him another way of living and working, taking time off and enjoying activities for which he initially had little time.\nSentence 31:\nAs a result, his strong interest towards his business is put aside.\nSentence 32:\nHe decides that he would rather help Morse than take over his company.\nSentence 33:\nFurious, Philip goes to the hotel to confront Edward, but only finds Vivian there.\nSentence 34:\nHe blames her for changing Edward and tries to rape her.\nSentence 35:\nEdward arrives in time to stop Philip, chastising him for his greed and ordering him to leave the room.\nSentence 36:\nEdward tends to Vivian and tries to persuade her to stay with him because she wants to, not because he's paying her.\nSentence 37:\nShe refuses once again and returns to the apartment she shares with Kit, preparing to leave for San Francisco to earn a G.E.D. in the hopes of a better life.\nSentence 38:\nEdward gets into the car with the chauffeur that took her home.\nSentence 39:\nInstead of going to the airport, he goes to her apartment arriving accompanied by music from La Traviata.\nSentence 40:\nHe climbs up the fire escape, despite his fear of heights, with a bouquet of roses clutched between his teeth, to woo her.\nSentence 41:\nHis leaping from the white limousine, and then climbing the outside ladder and steps, is a visual urban metaphor for the knight on white horse rescuing the \"princess\" from the tower, a childhood fantasy Vivian told him about.\nSentence 42:\nThe film ends as the two of them kiss on the fire escape."

Change of Plans: An event where the main goal of the story is defined, leading to increased action, driving the narrative from the introduction of new situation to it's progress.\n3. Point of No Return: An event that pushes the main character(s) to fully commit to their goal, driving the narrative from the progress to it's complications and high-stake difficulties.\n4. Major Setback: An event where everything falls apart (temporarily or permanently), progressing the story from complications to the final push. \n5. Climax: The final event of the main story, the moment of resolution, and the 'biggest spoiler', progressing the story from the final push to the aftermath of the main plot.\n\n Turning points always occur in the given order. You will be provided with the plot synopsis of a movie, and your task is to find all the 5 turning points. Provide reasoning behind each turning point, and the final output should be the sentence number for each Turning point, starting from 0. \nPLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nSentence 0:\nEdward Lewis (Gere), a successful businessman and \"corporate raider\", takes a detour on Hollywood Boulevard to ask for directions.\nSentence 1:\nReceiving little help, he encounters a prostitute named Vivian Ward (Roberts) who is willing to assist him in getting to his destination.\nSentence 2:\nThe morning after, Edward hires Vivian to stay with him for a week as an escort for social events.\nSentence 3:\nVivian advises him that it \"will cost him,\" and Edward agrees to give her $3,000 and access to his credit cards.\nSentence 4:\nVivian then goes shopping on Rodeo Drive, only to be snubbed by saleswomen who disdain her because of her unsophisticated appearance.\nSentence 5:\nInitially, hotel manager Barnard Thompson (Hector Elizondo) is also somewhat taken aback.\nSentence 6:\nBut he relents and decides to help her buy a dress, even coaching her on dinner etiquette.\nSentence 7:\nEdward returns and is visibly amazed by Vivian's transformation.\nSentence 8:\nThe business dinner does not end well, however, with Edward making clear his intention to dismantle Morse's corporation once it was bought, close down the shipyard which Morse spent 40 years building, and sell the land for real estate.\nSentence 9:\nMorse and his grandson abandon their dinner in anger, while Edward remains preoccupied with the deal afterward.\nSentence 10:\nBack at the hotel, Edward reveals to Vivian that he had not spoken to his recently deceased father for 14 and half years.\nSentence 11:\nLater that night, the two make love on the grand piano in the hotel lounge.\nSentence 12:\nThe next morning, Vivian tells Edward about the snubbing that took place the day before.\nSentence 13:\nEdward takes Vivian on a shopping spree.\nSentence 14:\nVivian then returns, carrying all the bags, to the shop that had snubbed her, telling the salesgirls they had made a big mistake.\nSentence 15:\nThe following day, Edward takes Vivian to a polo match where he is interested in networking for his business deal.\nSentence 16:\nWhile Vivian chats with David Morse, the grandson of the man involved in Edward's latest deal, Philip Stuckey (Edward's attorney) wonders if she is a spy.\nSentence 17:\nEdward re-assures him by telling him how they met, and Philip (Jason Alexander) then approaches Vivian and offers to hire her once she is finished with Edward, inadvertently insulting her.\nSentence 18:\nWhen they return to the hotel, she is furious with Edward for telling Phillip about her.\nSentence 19:\nShe plans to leave, but he apologizes and persuades her to see out the week.\nSentence 20:\nEdward leaves work early the next day and takes a breath-taking Vivian on a date to the opera in San Francisco in his private jet.\nSentence 21:\nShe is clearly moved by the opera (which is La Traviata, whose plot deals with a rich man tragically falling in love with a courtesan).\nSentence 22:\nWhile playing chess with Edward after returning, Vivian persuades him to take the next day off.\nSentence 23:\nThey spend the entire day together, and then have sex, in a personal rather than professional way.\nSentence 24:\nJust before she falls asleep, Vivian admits that she's in love with Edward.\nSentence 25:\nOver breakfast, Edward offers to put Vivian up in an apartment so he can continue seeing her.\nSentence 26:\nShe feels insulted and says this is not the \"fairy tale\" she wants.\nSentence 27:\nHe then goes off to work without resolving the situation.\nSentence 28:\nVivian's friend, Kit De Luca (Laura San Giacomo), comes to the hotel and realizes that Vivian is in love with Edward.\nSentence 29:\nEdward meets with Mr. Morse, about to close the deal, and changes his mind at the last minute.\nSentence 30:\nHis time with Vivian has shown him another way of living and working, taking time off and enjoying activities for which he initially had little time.\nSentence 31:\nAs a result, his strong interest towards his business is put aside.\nSentence 32:\nHe decides that he would rather help Morse than take over his company.\nSentence 33:\nFurious, Philip goes to the hotel to confront Edward, but only finds Vivian there.\nSentence 34:\nHe blames her for changing Edward and tries to rape her.\nSentence 35:\nEdward arrives in time to stop Philip, chastising him for his greed and ordering him to leave the room.\nSentence 36:\nEdward tends to Vivian and tries to persuade her to stay with him because she wants to, not because he's paying her.\nSentence 37:\nShe refuses once again and returns to the apartment she shares with Kit, preparing to leave for San Francisco to earn a G.E.D. in the hopes of a better life.\nSentence 38:\nEdward gets into the car with the chauffeur that took her home.\nSentence 39:\nInstead of going to the airport, he goes to her apartment arriving accompanied by music from La Traviata.\nSentence 40:\nHe climbs up the fire escape, despite his fear of heights, with a bouquet of roses clutched between his teeth, to woo her.\nSentence 41:\nHis leaping from the white limousine, and then climbing the outside ladder and steps, is a visual urban metaphor for the knight on white horse rescuing the \"princess\" from the tower, a childhood fantasy Vivian told him about.\nSentence 42:\nThe film ends as the two of them kiss on the fire escape.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 1): This is the opportunity turning point because it marks the beginning of the story's progression from setup to new situation, where Edward meets Vivian, a prostitute who will change his life. This encounter sets the stage for their unlikely relationship.\n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 10): This is the change of plans turning point because it reveals Edward's vulnerable side and deepens his connection with Vivian, making their relationship more personal and emotional. This moment shifts the narrative from the introduction of the new situation to its progress.\n\nTurning Point 3 (Sentence 24): This is the point of no return turning point because Vivian admits her love for Edward, marking a turning point in their relationship where they both become more invested in each other. This moment drives the narrative from progress to complications and higher stakes.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 37): This is the major setback turning point because Vivian refuses Edward's offer to stay with him and decides to leave, marking a temporary collapse of their relationship. This moment progresses the story from complications to the final push.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 42): This is the climax turning point because it marks the resolution of the main story, where Edward wins Vivian back by making a grand romantic gesture, and they share a kiss on the fire escape. This moment progresses the story from the final push to the aftermath of the main plot.\nFINAL ANSWER:\n1,10,24,37,42<|eot_id|>"

the Newcomer robbers are using high-powered weapons using sabot rounds, one of which kills Tuggle even through the vehicle he is using for cover.\nSentence 5:\nThe next day, Sykes' superior Captain Warner (McCarthy), informs his squad that they will have to work with the newly promoted Newcomer detective Sam Francisco (Patinkin), and that if nobody volunteers, he will choose someone to carry out those duties.\nSentence 6:\nAlthough having racist opinions about \"Slags\", Sykes enlists to work with Francisco to investigate a similar homicide with a Newcomer named Warren Hubely; feeling that if he investigates that crime, he will also find opportunities to investigate his partner's death which he is officially forbidden to do.\nSentence 7:\nMeanwhile, Warner assigns the robbery murder case to detectives Fedorchuk (Jason) and Alterez (Perez).\nSentence 8:\nShowing no faith in their ability to find the truth, Sykes requisitions a powerful .454 Casull revolver for a sidearm to be more effective dealing with Newcomers.\nSentence 9:\nAs the troubled pair continue with the Hubely-homicide probe; Sykes discovers similarities between their case and the robbery, while at a crime lab, Francisco detects an abnormality on the body of one of the Newcomer criminals who was killed in the robbery with pathologist Mr. Winter (Young).\nSentence 10:\nFollowing an interview with a Newcomer named Trent Porter (Thompson), who is also the son of the innocent Newcomer fatality during the robbery; Sykes and Francisco are led to a nightclub called Encounters to investigate a link in the homicides with a Newcomer named Joshua Strader (Kober).\nSentence 11:\nHowever, they end up interviewing his girlfriend Cassandra (Bevis) instead, after he is murdered by a criminal ring led by Newcomer businessman William Harcourt (Stamp) and his henchman Rudyard Kipling (Howard).\nSentence 12:\nHarcourt is in the latter stages of launching advanced plans to exploit the alien race by attempting to mass-produce and sell a drug called Jabroka.\nSentence 13:\nThe drug was used in the past to pacify the Newcomers when they were slaves, but has no effect on humans.\nSentence 14:\nThe abnormality noticed by Francisco on the body of the Newcomer criminal earlier, was a visual sign of the drug's influence.\nSentence 15:\nIn addition, the Newcomers Hubley, Porter and Strader were involved in the planning phases of the operation, but were later murdered due to Harcourt's desire to exclude them from any future financial rewards.\nSentence 16:\nUltimately, Sykes and Francisco track down Harcourt to the Encounters club, where he is secretly negotiating a timetable for the release of his potent narcotic.\nSentence 17:\nThe detectives attempt to foil his plans, as they are later led on a car chase with Harcourt and his cohort Kipling, through the streets of downtown Los Angeles.\nSentence 18:\nFollowing a head-on automobile collision where Francisco is injured and Kipling subsequently killed, Sykes on foot, corners Harcourt onto a desolate drawbridge.\nSentence 19:\nHarcourt then purposely overdoses on a sample of the controlled-substance he was illegally trying to distribute to the Newcomers.\nSentence 20:\nAs Sykes mistakenly believes he died, Harcourt is taken away by an ambulance, but later mutates into a significantly larger and more muscular Newcomer intent on causing violence.\nSentence 21:\nAfter Francisco discovers Sykes' misstep, the duo pursue Harcourt.\nSentence 22:\nCatching up with Harcourt near a fishing pier, Sykes leads him onto the deck of a fishing trawler.\nSentence 23:\nThe pair then end up in a physical confrontation in the open sea.\nSentence 24:\nHarcourt dies, as his body disintegrates due to the effects of direct contact with salt water, which is hazardous towards Newcomer physiology.\nSentence 25:\nFrancisco commandeers a police helicopter, forcing himself to pull Sykes from the water even as it burns the flesh of his arm.\nSentence 26:\nWith the Tuggle and Newcomer murder cases solved, the authorities dismantle Harcourt's illicit scheme involved in trying to subdue the aliens, and Sykes invites Francisco to his daughter's wedding, pausing to apologize in advance for all the hateful things he knows he will say.\nSentence 27:\nFrancisco accepts, telling him, \"After all...you are only human.\""

the Newcomer robbers are using high-powered weapons using sabot rounds, one of which kills Tuggle even through the vehicle he is using for cover.\nSentence 5:\nThe next day, Sykes' superior Captain Warner (McCarthy), informs his squad that they will have to work with the newly promoted Newcomer detective Sam Francisco (Patinkin), and that if nobody volunteers, he will choose someone to carry out those duties.\nSentence 6:\nAlthough having racist opinions about \"Slags\", Sykes enlists to work with Francisco to investigate a similar homicide with a Newcomer named Warren Hubely; feeling that if he investigates that crime, he will also find opportunities to investigate his partner's death which he is officially forbidden to do.\nSentence 7:\nMeanwhile, Warner assigns the robbery murder case to detectives Fedorchuk (Jason) and Alterez (Perez).\nSentence 8:\nShowing no faith in their ability to find the truth, Sykes requisitions a powerful .454 Casull revolver for a sidearm to be more effective dealing with Newcomers.\nSentence 9:\nAs the troubled pair continue with the Hubely-homicide probe; Sykes discovers similarities between their case and the robbery, while at a crime lab, Francisco detects an abnormality on the body of one of the Newcomer criminals who was killed in the robbery with pathologist Mr. Winter (Young).\nSentence 10:\nFollowing an interview with a Newcomer named Trent Porter (Thompson), who is also the son of the innocent Newcomer fatality during the robbery; Sykes and Francisco are led to a nightclub called Encounters to investigate a link in the homicides with a Newcomer named Joshua Strader (Kober).\nSentence 11:\nHowever, they end up interviewing his girlfriend Cassandra (Bevis) instead, after he is murdered by a criminal ring led by Newcomer businessman William Harcourt (Stamp) and his henchman Rudyard Kipling (Howard).\nSentence 12:\nHarcourt is in the latter stages of launching advanced plans to exploit the alien race by attempting to mass-produce and sell a drug called Jabroka.\nSentence 13:\nThe drug was used in the past to pacify the Newcomers when they were slaves, but has no effect on humans.\nSentence 14:\nThe abnormality noticed by Francisco on the body of the Newcomer criminal earlier, was a visual sign of the drug's influence.\nSentence 15:\nIn addition, the Newcomers Hubley, Porter and Strader were involved in the planning phases of the operation, but were later murdered due to Harcourt's desire to exclude them from any future financial rewards.\nSentence 16:\nUltimately, Sykes and Francisco track down Harcourt to the Encounters club, where he is secretly negotiating a timetable for the release of his potent narcotic.\nSentence 17:\nThe detectives attempt to foil his plans, as they are later led on a car chase with Harcourt and his cohort Kipling, through the streets of downtown Los Angeles.\nSentence 18:\nFollowing a head-on automobile collision where Francisco is injured and Kipling subsequently killed, Sykes on foot, corners Harcourt onto a desolate drawbridge.\nSentence 19:\nHarcourt then purposely overdoses on a sample of the controlled-substance he was illegally trying to distribute to the Newcomers.\nSentence 20:\nAs Sykes mistakenly believes he died, Harcourt is taken away by an ambulance, but later mutates into a significantly larger and more muscular Newcomer intent on causing violence.\nSentence 21:\nAfter Francisco discovers Sykes' misstep, the duo pursue Harcourt.\nSentence 22:\nCatching up with Harcourt near a fishing pier, Sykes leads him onto the deck of a fishing trawler.\nSentence 23:\nThe pair then end up in a physical confrontation in the open sea.\nSentence 24:\nHarcourt dies, as his body disintegrates due to the effects of direct contact with salt water, which is hazardous towards Newcomer physiology.\nSentence 25:\nFrancisco commandeers a police helicopter, forcing himself to pull Sykes from the water even as it burns the flesh of his arm.\nSentence 26:\nWith the Tuggle and Newcomer murder cases solved, the authorities dismantle Harcourt's illicit scheme involved in trying to subdue the aliens, and Sykes invites Francisco to his daughter's wedding, pausing to apologize in advance for all the hateful things he knows he will say.\nSentence 27:\nFrancisco accepts, telling him, \"After all...you are only human.\"<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 4): This is the opportunity that drives the narrative from setup to new situation, as it introduces the central conflict of the story - the murder of a Newcomer and the subsequent investigation.

startled by lightning, he drops and ruins Delbruck's brain.\nSentence 10:\nTaking a second brain, Igor returns with a brain labeled \"Do Not Use This Brain!\nSentence 11:\nAbnormal\" (which he subsequently refers to as \"A-b (Abby) Normal\"), which Frederick unknowingly transplants into the corpse.\nSentence 12:\nSoon, Frederick is ready to re-animate his creature (Peter Boyle), who is elevated on a platform to the roof of the laboratory during a lightning storm.\nSentence 13:\nEventually, electrical charges bring the creature to life.\nSentence 14:\nThe creature makes its first halting steps, but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, attacks Frederick and must be sedated.\nSentence 15:\nUpon being asked whose brain was obtained, Igor confesses that he supplied \"Abby Normal's\" (abnormal) brain, unknowingly creating the Monster.\nSentence 16:\nThe townspeople are uneasy at the possibility of Frederick continuing his grandfather's work.\nSentence 17:\nMost concerned is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars), a police official who sports an eyepatch and monocle over the same eye, a creaky, disjointed wooden arm, and an accent so comically thick even his own countrymen cannot understand him.\nSentence 18:\nKemp visits the doctor and subsequently demands assurance that he will not create another monster.\nSentence 19:\nUpon returning to the lab, Frederick discovers that Frau Bl\u00fccher is setting the creature free.\nSentence 20:\nAfter she reveals the monster's love of violin music, and her own romantic relationship with Frederick's grandfather, the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch, and escapes from the Frankenstein castle.\nSentence 21:\nWhile roaming the countryside, the Monster has frustrating encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit (Gene Hackman); these scenes directly parody the original Frankenstein movies.\nSentence 22:\nFrederick recaptures the monster and locks the two of them in a room, where he calms the monster's homicidal tendencies with flattery and fully acknowledges his own heritage, shouting out emphatically, \"My name is Frankenstein!\"\nSentence 23:\n(This time, he uses the more common, Anglicized pronunciation.)\nSentence 24:\nFrederick offers the sight of \"The Creature\" following simple commands to a theater full of illustrious guests.\nSentence 25:\nThe demonstration continues with Frederick and the monster launching into the musical number \"Puttin' on the Ritz,\" complete with top hats and tails.\nSentence 26:\nAlthough the monster can only shout his song lines in painfully high-pitched monotones, he dances impressively with almost perfect timing.\nSentence 27:\nThe routine ends disastrously, however, when a stage light explodes and frightens the monster, who becomes enraged, pushes Frederick, and charges into the audience, where he is captured and chained by police.\nSentence 28:\nThe monster escapes, then kidnaps and ravishes the not unwilling Elizabeth when she arrives unexpectedly for a visit.\nSentence 29:\nElizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his inhuman stamina and his enormous penis (referred to as Schwanstuker or Schwanzst\u00fcck\u00a0\u2014 a Yiddish word from Schwanz, \"tail,\" which also is German slang for \"penis,\" and St\u00fcck, \"piece\").\nSentence 30:\nThe townspeople hunt for the monster.\nSentence 31:\nDesperate to get the creature back, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle.\nSentence 32:\nJust as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature who, as a result, is able to reason with and placate the mob.\nSentence 33:\nThe film ends happily, with Elizabeth married to the now erudite and sophisticated monster--with her hair styled identically to that of the female creature from The Bride Of Frankenstein, while Inga joyfully learns what her new husband Frederick got in return during the transfer procedure--the monster's Schwanzst\u00fcck."

Change of Plans: An event where the main goal of the story is defined, leading to increased action, driving the narrative from the introduction of new situation to it's progress.\n3. Point of No Return: An event that pushes the main character(s) to fully commit to their goal, driving the narrative from the progress to it's complications and high-stake difficulties.\n4. Major Setback: An event where everything falls apart (temporarily or permanently), progressing the story from complications to the final push. \n5. Climax: The final event of the main story, the moment of resolution, and the 'biggest spoiler', progressing the story from the final push to the aftermath of the main plot.\n\n Turning points always occur in the given order.

startled by lightning, he drops and ruins Delbruck's brain.\nSentence 10:\nTaking a second brain, Igor returns with a brain labeled \"Do Not Use This Brain!\nSentence 11:\nAbnormal\" (which he subsequently refers to as \"A-b (Abby) Normal\"), which Frederick unknowingly transplants into the corpse.\nSentence 12:\nSoon, Frederick is ready to re-animate his creature (Peter Boyle), who is elevated on a platform to the roof of the laboratory during a lightning storm.\nSentence 13:\nEventually, electrical charges bring the creature to life.\nSentence 14:\nThe creature makes its first halting steps, but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, attacks Frederick and must be sedated.\nSentence 15:\nUpon being asked whose brain was obtained, Igor confesses that he supplied \"Abby Normal's\" (abnormal) brain, unknowingly creating the Monster.\nSentence 16:\nThe townspeople are uneasy at the possibility of Frederick continuing his grandfather's work.\nSentence 17:\nMost concerned is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars), a police official who sports an eyepatch and monocle over the same eye, a creaky, disjointed wooden arm, and an accent so comically thick even his own countrymen cannot understand him.\nSentence 18:\nKemp visits the doctor and subsequently demands assurance that he will not create another monster.\nSentence 19:\nUpon returning to the lab, Frederick discovers that Frau Bl\u00fccher is setting the creature free.\nSentence 20:\nAfter she reveals the monster's love of violin music, and her own romantic relationship with Frederick's grandfather, the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch, and escapes from the Frankenstein castle.\nSentence 21:\nWhile roaming the countryside, the Monster has frustrating encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit (Gene Hackman); these scenes directly parody the original Frankenstein movies.\nSentence 22:\nFrederick recaptures the monster and locks the two of them in a room, where he calms the monster's homicidal tendencies with flattery and fully acknowledges his own heritage, shouting out emphatically, \"My name is Frankenstein!\"\nSentence 23:\n(This time, he uses the more common, Anglicized pronunciation.)\nSentence 24:\nFrederick offers the sight of \"The Creature\" following simple commands to a theater full of illustrious guests.\nSentence 25:\nThe demonstration continues with Frederick and the monster launching into the musical number \"Puttin' on the Ritz,\" complete with top hats and tails.\nSentence 26:\nAlthough the monster can only shout his song lines in painfully high-pitched monotones, he dances impressively with almost perfect timing.\nSentence 27:\nThe routine ends disastrously, however, when a stage light explodes and frightens the monster, who becomes enraged, pushes Frederick, and charges into the audience, where he is captured and chained by police.\nSentence 28:\nThe monster escapes, then kidnaps and ravishes the not unwilling Elizabeth when she arrives unexpectedly for a visit.\nSentence 29:\nElizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his inhuman stamina and his enormous penis (referred to as Schwanstuker or Schwanzst\u00fcck\u00a0\u2014 a Yiddish word from Schwanz, \"tail,\" which also is German slang for \"penis,\" and St\u00fcck, \"piece\").\nSentence 30:\nThe townspeople hunt for the monster.\nSentence 31:\nDesperate to get the creature back, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle.\nSentence 32:\nJust as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature who, as a result, is able to reason with and placate the mob.\nSentence 33:\nThe film ends happily, with Elizabeth married to the now erudite and sophisticated monster--with her hair styled identically to that of the female creature from The Bride Of Frankenstein, while Inga joyfully learns what her new husband Frederick got in return during the transfer procedure--the monster's Schwanzst\u00fcck."

startled by lightning, he drops and ruins Delbruck's brain.\nSentence 10:\nTaking a second brain, Igor returns with a brain labeled \"Do Not Use This Brain!\nSentence 11:\nAbnormal\" (which he subsequently refers to as \"A-b (Abby) Normal\"), which Frederick unknowingly transplants into the corpse.\nSentence 12:\nSoon, Frederick is ready to re-animate his creature (Peter Boyle), who is elevated on a platform to the roof of the laboratory during a lightning storm.\nSentence 13:\nEventually, electrical charges bring the creature to life.\nSentence 14:\nThe creature makes its first halting steps, but, frightened by Igor lighting a match, attacks Frederick and must be sedated.\nSentence 15:\nUpon being asked whose brain was obtained, Igor confesses that he supplied \"Abby Normal's\" (abnormal) brain, unknowingly creating the Monster.\nSentence 16:\nThe townspeople are uneasy at the possibility of Frederick continuing his grandfather's work.\nSentence 17:\nMost concerned is Inspector Kemp (Kenneth Mars), a police official who sports an eyepatch and monocle over the same eye, a creaky, disjointed wooden arm, and an accent so comically thick even his own countrymen cannot understand him.\nSentence 18:\nKemp visits the doctor and subsequently demands assurance that he will not create another monster.\nSentence 19:\nUpon returning to the lab, Frederick discovers that Frau Bl\u00fccher is setting the creature free.\nSentence 20:\nAfter she reveals the monster's love of violin music, and her own romantic relationship with Frederick's grandfather, the creature is enraged by sparks from a thrown switch, and escapes from the Frankenstein castle.\nSentence 21:\nWhile roaming the countryside, the Monster has frustrating encounters with a young girl and a blind hermit (Gene Hackman); these scenes directly parody the original Frankenstein movies.\nSentence 22:\nFrederick recaptures the monster and locks the two of them in a room, where he calms the monster's homicidal tendencies with flattery and fully acknowledges his own heritage, shouting out emphatically, \"My name is Frankenstein!\"\nSentence 23:\n(This time, he uses the more common, Anglicized pronunciation.)\nSentence 24:\nFrederick offers the sight of \"The Creature\" following simple commands to a theater full of illustrious guests.\nSentence 25:\nThe demonstration continues with Frederick and the monster launching into the musical number \"Puttin' on the Ritz,\" complete with top hats and tails.\nSentence 26:\nAlthough the monster can only shout his song lines in painfully high-pitched monotones, he dances impressively with almost perfect timing.\nSentence 27:\nThe routine ends disastrously, however, when a stage light explodes and frightens the monster, who becomes enraged, pushes Frederick, and charges into the audience, where he is captured and chained by police.\nSentence 28:\nThe monster escapes, then kidnaps and ravishes the not unwilling Elizabeth when she arrives unexpectedly for a visit.\nSentence 29:\nElizabeth falls in love with the creature due to his inhuman stamina and his enormous penis (referred to as Schwanstuker or Schwanzst\u00fcck\u00a0\u2014 a Yiddish word from Schwanz, \"tail,\" which also is German slang for \"penis,\" and St\u00fcck, \"piece\").\nSentence 30:\nThe townspeople hunt for the monster.\nSentence 31:\nDesperate to get the creature back, Frederick plays the violin to lure his creation back to the castle.\nSentence 32:\nJust as the Kemp-led mob storms the laboratory, Frankenstein transfers some of his stabilizing intellect to the creature who, as a result, is able to reason with and placate the mob.\nSentence 33:\nThe film ends happily, with Elizabeth married to the now erudite and sophisticated monster--with her hair styled identically to that of the female creature from The Bride Of Frankenstein, while Inga joyfully learns what her new husband Frederick got in return during the transfer procedure--the monster's Schwanzst\u00fcck.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 3): This is the opportunity that drives the narrative from setup to new situation, as Frederick inherits his family's estate in Transylvania and decides to travel to Europe to inspect the property, marking a significant change in his life.

Imhotep was sentenced to immortal agony, condemned to suffer the Hom Dai curse, buried alive with flesh-eating scarab beetles.\nSentence 6:\nHe was buried under high security, sealed away in a sarcophagus at the feet of a statue of the Egyptian god Anubis, and kept under strict surveillance by warriors known as the Medjai; for all humanity would be doomed should he resurface.\nSentence 7:\n4,159 years later in 1925, Jonathan Carnahan presents his sister Evelyn, a Cairo librarian and aspiring Egyptologist, an intricate box and map which Jonathan says he found in Thebes.\nSentence 8:\nAfter the pair discover the map leads to Hamunaptra, Jonathan reveals he stole it from an American adventurer named Rick O'Connell, currently in prison.\nSentence 9:\nEvelyn and Jonathan visit Rick; he tells them that he knows the location of the city because his unit of the French Foreign Legion found the location years ago.\nSentence 10:\nHe makes a deal with Evelyn to reveal the location of Hamunaptra, in exchange for Evelyn saving Rick from being hanged.\nSentence 11:\nRick leads Evelyn and Jonathan's small expedition to the city, where the group encounters a band of American treasure hunters led by the famed British Egyptologist Dr. Allen Chamberlain and guided by Beni Gabor, a cowardly former comrade of Rick.\nSentence 12:\nShortly after reaching Hamunaptra, the expeditions are attacked by the Medjai, led by the warrior Ardeth Bay.\nSentence 13:\nArdeth warns them of the evil buried in the city, but despite his warning, the two expeditions continue to excavate in separate portions of the city.\nSentence 14:\nEvelyn searches for the Book of Amun-Ra, a solid gold book reportedly capable of taking life away, but comes across the remains of Imhotep instead.\nSentence 15:\nThe team of Americans, meanwhile, discover a box containing the black Book of the Dead, accompanied by canopic jars carrying Anck-su-Namun's preserved organs; Chamberlain steals the Book of the Dead while each of the Americans pockets a jar as loot.\nSentence 16:\nBefore opening the box, Chamberlain reads an engraving saying that any and all who open the box are cursed if Imhotep is awakened.\nSentence 17:\nThe men ignore the warnings, but Beni refuses to assist them, and flees.\nSentence 18:\nAt night, Evelyn takes the Book of the Dead and reads a page aloud, accidentally awakening Imhotep.\nSentence 19:\nThe expeditions flee to Cairo, but Imhotep follows them with the help of Beni, who bargains with Imhotep; the antagonist promises not to kill Beni in return.\nSentence 20:\nImhotep absorbs the life from the American expedition, returning to full strength.\nSentence 21:\nSeeking a way to stop Imhotep, Rick, Evelyn and Jonathan meet Ardeth at a museum.\nSentence 22:\nAfter Evelyn reveals that Imhotep referred to her as Anck-su-Namun in Hamunaptra, Ardeth and museum curator Terrence Bay hypothesize that Imhotep wants to resurrect his lover again and will do so by sacrificing Evelyn.\nSentence 23:\nEvelyn muses that if the Book of the Dead brought Imhotep back to life, the Book of Amun-Ra can kill him again.\nSentence 24:\nAfter discovering the location of the Book, Imhotep corners the group with an army of slaves.\nSentence 25:\nEvelyn agrees to accompany Imhotep if he spares the lives of the rest of the group.\nSentence 26:\nImhotep goes back on his word and leaves his slaves to kill the group anyway.\nSentence 27:\nHowever, Rick discovers an entrance to the sewers and they escape.\nSentence 28:\nTerrence sacrifices himself to buy the others time to escape.\nSentence 29:\nImhotep, Evelyn and Beni return to Hamunaptra, pursued by Rick, Jonathan, and Ardeth.\nSentence 30:\nEvelyn is rescued after an intense battle with Imhotep's mummified priests, and she reads from the Book of Amun-Ra.\nSentence 31:\nImhotep becomes mortal, and Rick stabs him, forcing him into the River of Death.\nSentence 32:\nRapidly decaying, Imhotep leaves the world of the living, vowing revenge with the same words he carved into his sarcophagus, Death is only the beginning.\nSentence 33:\nWhile looting treasure from the pyramid, Beni accidentally sets off an ancient booby trap and is trapped by a swarm of flesh-eating scarabs as Hamunaptra collapses into the sand.\nSentence 34:\nThe heroes escape, although they lose the Book of Amun-Ra in the process.\nSentence 35:\nRick, Jonathan and Evelyn ride off into the sunset on a pair of camels laden with Beni's treasure.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 13): This is the opportunity turning point as it marks the moment when the main characters are warned of the evil buried in the city, but they choose to continue their expedition, driving the narrative from setup to new situation. This event sets the stage for the rest of the story, introducing the central conflict and the risks involved.\n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 21): This is the change of plans turning point as it marks the moment when the main characters realize Imhotep's true intentions and decide to stop him, defining the main goal of the story and increasing the action. This event shifts the focus from exploration to survival and sets the stage for the progress of the story.\n\nTurning Point 3 (Sentence 23): This is the point of no return turning point as it marks the moment when Evelyn realizes that the Book of Amun-Ra can kill Imhotep, and the group decides to pursue this lead, committing to their goal and increasing the stakes. This event pushes the main characters to fully commit to their goal, driving the narrative from progress to complications and high-stake difficulties.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 26): This is the major setback turning point as it marks the moment when Imhotep goes back on his word and leaves his slaves to kill the group, causing a significant setback and increasing the tension. This event makes it seem like all hope is lost, progressing the story from complications to the final push.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 31): This is the climax turning point as it marks the moment when Evelyn reads from the Book of Amun-Ra, making Imhotep mortal, and Rick stabs him, forcing him into the River of Death. This event is the final confrontation and resolution of the main conflict, progressing the story from the final push to the aftermath.\nFINAL ANSWER:\n13,21,23,26,31<|eot_id|>"

the \"minority report\", reflecting the potential future where a predicted killer would have done something different, is discarded.\nSentence 8:\nAccording to Dr. Hineman, the female precog Agatha is most likely to be the precog that witnesses the minority report.\nSentence 9:\nAnderton undergoes a dangerous underground eye replacement to avoid detection by the city's optical recognition system.\nSentence 10:\nHe travels back to PreCrime and kidnaps Agatha (Samantha Morton), which disables the precogs' hive mind and shuts down the system.\nSentence 11:\nAnderton takes Agatha to a shopping mall, and a hacker, who extracts both Agatha's vision of Crow's murder\u2014with no differences from the other two precogs, so there was no minority report\u2014and another of the murder of a woman named Anne Lively\u2014which Agatha also showed to Anderton the day before he was incriminated.\nSentence 12:\nAnderton and Agatha then head to the apartment where Crow is to be killed.\nSentence 13:\nInside, Anderton finds hundreds of pictures of children, one of which is of his son, and concludes that Crow is responsible for Sean's disappearance.\nSentence 14:\nWhen Crow arrives, Anderton holds him at gunpoint, but ultimately decides to control his anger and places Crow under arrest instead.\nSentence 15:\nCrow admits that he was hired to plant these photos and then be killed, so his family would be paid handsomely.\nSentence 16:\nSince Anderton refuses to kill him, Crow grabs the officer's hand and makes him fire at point-blank range, effectively committing suicide by cop.\nSentence 17:\nOn the run, Anderton and Agatha approach his ex-wife Lara for refuge.\nSentence 18:\nAnderton learns Lively was Agatha's former drug-addicted mother, once before a target of a failed murder attempt after requesting to see her daughter before her death.\nSentence 19:\nAnderton realizes that his knowledge of the Lively case is why he is being targeted.\nSentence 20:\nMeanwhile, Witwer assesses Crow's death and doubts that Anderton killed him in cold blood.\nSentence 21:\nHe comes to recognize that the archival footage of Lively's murder shows what appears to be a future echo (or precog seeing the perpetration again) by one of the visions, routinely discarded by PreCrime.\nSentence 22:\nHe, however, realizes this is a different murder as nearby water is rippling in a different direction from the original PreCrime vision.\nSentence 23:\nHe suspects someone used this to stage the first murder attempt, and then recreated the setting to actually kill Lively and avoid being detected by PreCrime.\nSentence 24:\nWitwer realizes that the murderer would had to have been someone high up in PreCrime to have access to the vision, and reports these findings to PreCrime's Director Lamar Burgess (Max von Sydow).\nSentence 25:\nBurgess, aware that the PreCrime division is currently disabled due to Agatha's absence, kills Witwer and frames Anderton for that murder as well.\nSentence 26:\nThe PreCrime unit eventually captures Anderton and restores Agatha to the system.\nSentence 27:\nBurgess attempts to comfort Lara, but accidentally reveals that he was the one that killed Lively.\nSentence 28:\nLara acts on this information and frees Anderton at gunpoint.\nSentence 29:\nAt a banquet to celebrate the success of the PreCrime unit attended by Burgess, Anderton plays back Agatha's vision of Lively's murder for the gathered crowd, which shows Burgess as the murderer.\nSentence 30:\nWhile Burgess begins to hunt down Anderton, a new PreCrime report is created: Anderton is the victim and Burgess, the murderer.\nSentence 31:\nWhen Burgess catches up to Anderton, Anderton explains the impossible situation: if Burgess kills Anderton, he proves the system works but at the cost of a life sentence, while if he does not, the system will not have worked and the PreCrime division will be shut down.\nSentence 32:\nAnderton explains the fundamental flaw in the system: if one knows his or her future, he or she can change it.\nSentence 33:\nBurgess resolves the dilemma by killing himself.\nSentence 34:\nThe PreCrime program is shut down and the prisoners are unconditionally pardoned and released, though police departments keep watch on many of them.\nSentence 35:\nAnderton and Lara remarry and start a new family.\nSentence 36:\nThe precogs are sent to an \"undisclosed location\", a small uncharted island in the North Atlantic Ocean to live out a full happy life in peace."

This event pushes Anderton to fully commit to his goal of uncovering the truth and seeking justice, and drives the narrative from progress to complications and high-stake difficulties.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 30): This is the major setback, as Burgess frames Anderton for Witwer's murder, and the PreCrime unit captures Anderton and restores Agatha to the system. This event temporarily sets back Anderton's progress and creates a new obstacle for him to overcome, driving the narrative from complications to the final push.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 33): This is the climax, as Burgess resolves the dilemma by killing himself, and the PreCrime program is shut down. This event is the moment of resolution and the 'biggest spoiler', and drives the narrative from the final push to the aftermath of the main plot.\nFINAL ANSWER:\n4,5,13,30,33<|eot_id|>"

1914.\nSentence 11:\nHe tells him that an inventor lived across the road who disappeared around the turn of the century and that his father wanted to keep the house in case the owner ever

rescue Weena, George climbs down a shaft and enters the subterranean caverns and is horrified to discover that the Eloi are little more than free range livestock to the Morlocks, who raise and cannibalise them.\nSentence 38:\nHe fights the Morlocks with the help of the Eloi, who prove to not be completely helpless, then escapes with them up the shafts to safety.\nSentence 39:\nUnder his direction, they drop dry dead tree branches into the shafts to feed the fire.\nSentence 40:\nThe entire area caves in, crushing and suffocating most of the Morlocks below.\nSentence 41:\nThe next morning, George finds the sphinx-building in charred ruins and the doors to the building open again, with his time machine sitting just inside the entrance.\nSentence 42:\nHe goes to retrieve his machine, but the doors close behind him and he is attacked by the remaining Morlocks.\nSentence 43:\nHe uses the time machine to escape back to January 5, 1900 in time to meet his old friends for dinner and to tell them of his time traveling adventure.\nSentence 44:\nGeorge's friends scoff at his story and leave; only Filby believes him.\nSentence 45:\nGeorge leaves again in the time

tell of a centuries-long nuclear war/holocaust.\nSentence 33:\nOne group of survivors remained underground in the shelters and evolved into the Morlocks, while the other group, which became the Eloi, returned to the surface.\nSentence 34:\nGeorge starts climbing down a shaft, but turns back when a siren begins blaring from atop the sphinx-building.\nSentence 35:\nWeena and the rest of the Eloi enter a trance-like state, and complacently file through the now-open doors of the building.\nSentence 36:\nWhen the siren stops, the doors close, trapping Weena and others inside.\nSentence 37:\nTo rescue Weena, George climbs down a shaft and enters the subterranean caverns and is horrified to discover that the Eloi are little more than free range livestock to the Morlocks, who raise and cannibalise them.\nSentence 38:\nHe fights the Morlocks with the help of the Eloi, who prove to not be completely helpless, then escapes with them up the shafts to safety.\nSentence 39:\nUnder his direction, they drop dry dead tree branches into the shafts to feed the fire.\nSentence 40:\nThe entire area caves in, crushing and suffocating most of the Morlocks below.\nSentence 41:\nThe next morning, George finds the sphinx-building in charred ruins and the doors to the building open again, with his time machine sitting just inside the entrance.\nSentence 42:\nHe goes to retrieve his machine, but the doors close behind him and he is attacked by the remaining Morlocks.\nSentence 43:\nHe uses the time machine to escape back to January 5, 1900 in time to meet his old friends for dinner and to tell them of his time traveling adventure.\nSentence 44:\nGeorge's friends scoff at his story and leave; only Filby believes him.\nSentence 45:\nGeorge leaves again in the time machine.\nSentence 46:\nFilby and George's housekeeper notice three books are missing from George's library which he apparently took with him.\nSentence 47:\nThey, and the viewer, are left to speculate which three books were removed.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 8): This is the Opportunity turning point, as it marks the beginning of George's time-traveling adventure, driving the narrative from setup to new situation. This event sets the story in motion and introduces the central plot device of the time machine.\n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 8): This is the Change of Plans turning point, as it marks the point where George's goal of exploring the future is defined, leading to increased action and driving the narrative from the introduction of the new situation to its progress. This event sets the stage for George's journey through time.\n\nTurning Point 3 (Sentence 27): This is the Point of No Return turning point, as it marks the point where George's time machine is taken by the Morlocks, forcing him to fully commit to his goal of rescuing Weena and escaping the future. This event raises the stakes and creates complications for George.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 36): This is the Major Setback turning point, as it marks the point where Weena and the Eloi are trapped by the Morlocks, and George must come up with a new plan to rescue them. This event creates a major obstacle for George and sets the stage for the final push.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 43): This is the Climax turning point, as it marks the final event of the main story, where George escapes the Morlocks and returns to his own time.

2:\nTruman's hometown of Seahaven is a complete set built under a giant arcological dome in the Los Angeles area.\nSentence 3:\nTruman's family and friends are all played by actors allowing Christof to control every aspect of Truman's life.\nSentence 4:\nTo prevent Truman from discovering his false reality, Christof has invented means of dissuading his sense of exploration, including \"killing\"

her.\nSentence 14:\nTruman attempts to leave Seahaven but is blocked by his inability to arrange flights, bus breakdowns, sudden traffic jams, a forest fire and a nuclear meltdown \u2013 which he becomes skeptical of when the policeman, whom Truman had never met before, calls him by name.\nSentence 15:\nAfter Meryl breaks down and is taken off the show, Christof officially brings back Truman's father, hoping his presence will keep Truman from trying to leave.\nSentence 16:\nHowever, he only provides a temporary respite: Truman soon becomes isolated and begins staying alone in his basement after Meryl leaves him.\nSentence 17:\nOne night, Truman fools the cameras and escapes the basement undetected via a secret tunnel, forcing Christof to temporarily suspend broadcasting of the show for the first time in its history.\nSentence 18:\nThis causes a surge in viewership, with many viewers, including Sylvia, cheering on Truman's escape attempt.\nSentence 19:\nChristof orders every actor

her.\nSentence 14:\nTruman attempts to leave Seahaven but is blocked by his inability to arrange flights, bus breakdowns, sudden traffic jams, a forest fire and a nuclear meltdown \u2013 which he becomes skeptical of when the policeman, whom Truman had never met before, calls him by name.\nSentence 15:\nAfter Meryl breaks down and is taken off the show, Christof officially brings back Truman's father, hoping his presence will keep Truman from trying to leave.\nSentence 16:\nHowever, he only provides a temporary respite: Truman soon becomes isolated and begins staying alone in his basement after Meryl leaves him.\nSentence 17:\nOne night, Truman fools the cameras and escapes the basement undetected via a secret tunnel, forcing Christof to temporarily suspend broadcasting of the show for the first time in its history.\nSentence 18:\nThis causes a surge in viewership, with many viewers, including Sylvia, cheering on Truman's escape attempt.\nSentence 19:\nChristof orders every actor

Eighteen sure votes.\")\nSentence 12:\n.\nSentence 13:\nConversations between the hijackers reveal that Blue was a mercenary soldier in Africa and Green was a motorman framed by the Transit Police in a drugs bust.\nSentence 14:\nThere is also an undercurrent of tension between Blue and Grey; Blue confides to Green that he believes Grey is \"mad\" and potentially trouble.\nSentence 15:\nDuring the tense wait for the money, an armed police officer in the tunnel shoots at Brown (Earl Hindman), and hijackers and police exchange fire.\nSentence 16:\nIn retaliation, Blue kills the conductor.\nSentence 17:\nThe police dispatch a squad car carrying the ransom money.\nSentence 18:\nWhen the car is wrecked in a collision, Garber daringly bluffs to buy some time, telling the hijackers that the money already has been delivered to the 28th Street Station and only the walk down the tunnel is delaying it.\nSentence 19:\nA reluctant Blue agrees to the delay.\nSentence 20:\nA police motorcycle completes the trip from the scene of the collision to the subway station and two unarmed officers are sent down the track on foot to deliver the money to the hijackers.\nSentence 21:\nWith the money finally in hand, Blue gives Garber their next demands: that electric power be restored to the subway line, that all signals in the path of the train be set to green from 28th Street to South Ferry, and all police officers be cleared from the tunnel.\nSentence 22:\nHaving overridden the subway car's dead-man's switch, a safety device which requires a motorman to continually press down on the throttle or else the train will stop, the hijackers get off the train and set it in motion.\nSentence 23:\nAs the train starts to move, the undercover officer jumps off the train and hides between the rails.\nSentence 24:\nThe car begins to travel faster and faster, since no one is controlling its speed.\nSentence 25:\nWhile following the runaway train above ground, Garber becomes convinced that it is a diversion and that the hijackers must have left it.\nSentence 26:\nIn the tunnel, the hijackers discard their disguises and start their escape into the tunnel's emergency exit; however, Grey refuses to leave his gun behind as agreed, resulting in a stand-off with Blue, who shoots him dead.\nSentence 27:\nThe undercover officer, still hiding in the tracks, manages to kill Brown with one shot.\nSentence 28:\nGreen escapes onto the street, while Blue shoots at the officer until he wounds him.\nSentence 29:\nGarber arrives after Green has gotten away and, drawing on Blue, orders him to surrender just as Blue is about to kill the officer.\nSentence 30:\nFace to face at last, Blue asks Garber if the death penalty is available in the state of New York anymore.\nSentence 31:\nTold that it is not, Blue responds, \"pity\", then promptly electrocutes himself by stepping onto the third rail while a horrified Garber watches.\nSentence 32:\nMeanwhile the runaway car finally encounters a red signal while entering the South Ferry Loop.\nSentence 33:\nThe car's emergency brakes are tripped and it grinds to a halt; the remaining hostages are all safe.\nSentence 34:\nThe three dead hijackers are identified, and it is apparent that none has any experience piloting trains.\nSentence 35:\nGarber realizes that the hijacker still at large must be the former transit employee.\nSentence 36:\nHe and Patrone, working their way through a list of former motormen \"discharged for cause\" (and, by implication, disgruntled), pay a visit to Harold Longman.\nSentence 37:\nLongman\u2014known to the audience as Mr. Green\u2014is shown rolling in the packs of ransom money on the bed in his seedy efficiency apartment when Garber and Patrone knock on his door.\nSentence 38:\nHe hides the money quickly, then opens to the officers and bluffs his way through their questioning.\nSentence 39:\nThe officers find Longman's alibi weak, but start out the door, until Longman sneezes and Garber says \"Gesundheit.\"\nSentence 40:\nGarber then re-opens the door, and the expression on his face indicates that he knows he has just found the final hijacker.<|eot_id|><|start_header_id|>gpt<|end_header_id|>\n\nTurning Point 1 (Sentence 3): This is the opportunity that drives the narrative from setup to new situation, as it is the moment when the hijackers announce their presence and demands to the command center, setting the story in motion. The event is a turning point because it shifts the focus from the introduction of the characters to the main conflict of the story.\n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 18): This is the change of plans that drives the narrative from the introduction of the new situation to its progress, as it is the moment when Garber bluffs the hijackers to buy some time, showing his determination to resolve the situation. The event is a turning point because it marks a shift in the tone of the story, from a straightforward hostage situation to a more complex game of cat and mouse.\n\nTurning Point 3 (Sentence 21): This is the point of no return that drives the narrative from progress to complications and high-stake difficulties, as it is the moment when the hijackers make their final demands and set their escape plan in motion. The event is a turning point because it raises the stakes and creates tension, as the characters must now navigate a complex and dangerous situation.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 35): This is the major setback that drives the narrative from complications to the final push, as it is the moment when Garber realizes that the hijacker still at large must be the former transit employee, and the investigation shifts to finding the final culprit. The event is a turning point because it marks a shift in the focus of the story, from the resolution of the hostage situation to the pursuit of justice.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 40): This is the climax that drives the narrative from the final push to the aftermath, as it is the moment when Garber identifies the final hijacker and the story reaches its resolution. The event is a turning point because it provides a sense of closure and completion, as the main conflict of the story is finally resolved.\nFINAL ANSWER:\n1,18,21,35,40<|eot_id|>"

This decision changes the direction of their lives and sets the plot in motion.\n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 16): Although this is the ground truth for the second turning point, it does not fit the description of \"Change of Plans\". However, considering the context, a better fit for the second turning point would be Sentence 10, where Early decides to join Brian and Carrie on their trip, which changes the direction of the story and increases the action. \n\nTurning Point 2 (Sentence 10): This is the change of plans that drives the narrative from the introduction of the new situation to its progress, as Early joins Brian and Carrie on their trip, leading to a series of events that escalate the tension and action.\n\nTurning Point 3 (Sentence 20): This is the point of no return that drives the narrative from progress to complications and high-stake difficulties, as Early kills the gas station attendant and takes Brian and Carrie hostage, committing to his violent path and forcing the couple to fight for survival.\n\nTurning Point 4 (Sentence 26): This is the major setback that drives the narrative from complications to the final push, as Early fatally shoots Adele, kidnaps Carrie, and leaves Brian for dead, marking a low point for the couple and setting the stage for their desperate attempt to escape and defeat Early.\n\nTurning Point 5 (Sentence 32): This is the climax that drives the narrative from the final push to the aftermath, as Brian shoots Early again, killing him, and finally puts an end to the violence and terror, allowing the couple to begin the process of healing and recovery.\nFINAL ANSWER:\n2,16,20,26,32<|eot_id|>"

TPs are narrative moments from which the plot goes in a different direction, that is from one act to another. The five turning points are described as:\n1. Opportunity: An introductory event that occurs after presenting the setting and background of the main characters, driving the narrative from setup to new situation.\n2. Change of Plans: An event where the main goal of the story is defined, leading to increased action, driving the narrative from the introduction of new situation to it's progress.\n3. Point of No Return: An event that pushes the main character(s) to fully commit to their goal, driving the narrative from the progress to it's complications and high-stake difficulties.\n4. Major Setback: An event where everything falls apart (temporarily or permanently), progressing the story from complications to the final push. \n5. Climax: The final event of the main story, the moment of resolution, and the 'biggest spoiler', progressing the story from the final push to the aftermath of the main plot.\n\n Turning points always occur in the given order.

TPs are narrative moments from which the plot goes in a different direction, that is from one act to another. The five turning points are described as:\n1. Opportunity: An introductory event that occurs after presenting the setting and background of the main characters, driving the narrative from setup to new situation.\n2. Change of Plans: An event where the main goal of the story is defined, leading to increased action, driving the narrative from the introduction of new situation to it's progress.\n3. Point of No Return: An event that pushes the main character(s) to fully commit to their goal, driving the narrative from the progress to it's complications and high-stake difficulties.\n4. Major Setback: An event where everything falls apart (temporarily or permanently), progressing the story from complications to the final push. \n5. Climax: The final event of the main story, the moment of resolution, and the 'biggest spoiler', progressing the story from the final push to the aftermath of the main plot.\n\n Turning points always occur in the given order. You will be provided with the plot synopsis of a movie, and your task is to find all the 5 turning points. Provide reasoning behind each turning point, and the final output should be the sentence number for each Turning point, starting from 0. \nPLOT SYNOPSIS:\n\nSentence 0:\nJulius Benedict (Arnold Schwarzenegger) and Vincent Benedict (Danny DeVito) are fraternal twins, the results of a secret experiment carried out at a genetics laboratory to produce the perfect child.\nSentence 1:\nTo the surprise of the scientists, the embryo split and twins were born.\nSentence 2:\nThe mother, Mary Ann Benedict, was told that Julius died at birth, and not told about Vincent at all.\nSentence 3:\nJulius was informed that his mother died in childbirth.\nSentence 4:\nVincent believed his mother abandoned him.\nSentence 5:\nEach twin is unaware of the other's existence.\nSentence 6:\nVincent was placed in an orphanage run by nuns in Los Angeles while Julius was taken to a South Pacific island and raised by Professor Werner (Tony Jay).\nSentence 7:\nOn Julius' 35th birthday, Werner tells him that he has a twin brother.\nSentence 8:\n[1] Julius leaves the island to find him.\nSentence 9:\nJulius discovers Vincent lives in L.A., and travels throughout the city.\nSentence 10:\nThough intelligent, he is extremely na\u00efve about the real world his more streetwise brother inhabits;
